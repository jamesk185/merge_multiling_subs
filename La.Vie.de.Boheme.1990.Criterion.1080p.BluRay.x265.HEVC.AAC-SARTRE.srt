00:00:38,247 --> 00:00:42,167
Based on the Novel by HENRI MURGER

2
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:07,419
Shit!

3
00:02:13,842 --> 00:02:15,844
Did I hurt myself?

4
00:02:16,428 --> 00:02:18,722
My God - blood!

5
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:55,092
- Everything okay, Marcel?
- No.

6
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:58,804
What do you think, with the middle
of my face smashed in?

7
00:03:04,685 --> 00:03:06,228
Red wine.

8
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:46,143
These glasses are smaller
than a drunkard's dreams.

9
00:03:46,518 --> 00:03:49,938
- Any luck with the publisher?
- No, the swine!

10
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:52,941
He said it was too long
and demanded cuts,

11
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:56,486
but with no promises
and no advance - the lout!

12
00:03:56,611 --> 00:03:59,573
- Why not let me read it?
- You?

13
00:03:59,698 --> 00:04:00,866
Yes, me.

14
00:04:00,991 --> 00:04:02,826
You can read?

15
00:04:02,993 --> 00:04:04,745
Are you kidding?

16
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:07,789
I finished third grade in Mongéo
before coming to Paris.

17
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:10,125
I'll read it at bedtime.

18
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:12,169
Why not?

19
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:15,172
You'll give me the people's appraisal

20
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:18,467
and put the publishers to shame.

21
00:04:25,307 --> 00:04:29,644
<i>The Avenger - A Play in 21 Acts</i>
by Marcel Marx

22
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:24,968
EVICTION NOTICE

23
00:06:49,284 --> 00:06:51,328
Good morning, Monsieur Marcel.

24
00:06:51,453 --> 00:06:53,747
Have you forgotten
that today is the eighth?

25
00:06:53,872 --> 00:06:56,499
Already? How time rushes on!

26
00:06:58,293 --> 00:07:00,754
You're a bit slow
in vacating the premises.

27
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:02,797
It's already 11:30.

28
00:07:02,923 --> 00:07:05,008
The new tenant may arrive
at any moment.

29
00:07:05,175 --> 00:07:07,135
Allow me to find a moving van.

30
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:08,970
By all means!

31
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:13,099
But there's one little formality
to see to first:

32
00:07:14,017 --> 00:07:16,436
your three months' back rent.

33
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:19,105
Would you mind?
- Of course not.

34
00:07:19,814 --> 00:07:23,568
Then kindly step into my office,
so I may give you a receipt.

35
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:25,904
- When I return.
- Why not now?

36
00:07:26,029 --> 00:07:29,783
I must go to the bank.
I don't carry a sum like that on me.

37
00:07:33,495 --> 00:07:36,456
I see. No cash.

38
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:39,668
Then allow me to relieve you
of that little burden

39
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:42,003
so it doesn't tire you.

40
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:45,340
You think I'd carry off
my belongings in a bag?

41
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:47,342
Those are the rules.

42
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:50,804
You're not to remove so much as
a single hair until the rent is paid.

43
00:07:50,929 --> 00:07:52,806
There's no hair in here,

44
00:07:52,931 --> 00:07:55,517
just shirts I'm taking to the laundry

45
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:58,269
next door to the bank,
just steps from here.

46
00:07:58,395 --> 00:08:00,397
Please do not misunderstand me,

47
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:02,732
but certain unfortunate experiences

48
00:08:02,857 --> 00:08:05,652
have shattered my faith in tenants.

49
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:09,906
Hugo had best
accompany you to the bank.

50
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:20,041
See this man?

51
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:22,335
He's been casing this bank
for three days.

52
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:23,753
I live across the street.

53
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:26,214
His accomplice is around
the corner in an Alfa Romeo,

54
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:28,591
reading <i>Le Monde -</i> upside down.

55
00:08:28,717 --> 00:08:30,760
I only wish to do my duty.

56
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:32,971
My life's savings are in this bank.

57
00:08:33,096 --> 00:08:35,432
What do you suppose is in his bag?

58
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:01,374
Has my apartment been vacated?

59
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:04,419
Not yet, Monsieur Schaunard,
but very soon.

60
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:08,631
The previous tenant, a writer,
has gone to get a moving van.

61
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:12,761
In the meantime, you may
leave your furniture outside.

62
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:16,014
I'm afraid. If it rains,
my furniture will be damaged.

63
00:09:22,437 --> 00:09:25,273
You will forgive me
if I ask your profession.

64
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:28,735
You neglected
to indicate that on the lease.

65
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:35,950
Leave the piano here and return
at once to my old lodgings

66
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:39,162
for the rest
of my priceless furnishings

67
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:41,539
and works of art.

68
00:09:51,174 --> 00:09:55,845
Henri, from the Ministry of War.
It just arrived by courier.

69
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:58,181
The Ministry of War.

70
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:03,353
It must be the pension

71
00:10:03,478 --> 00:10:05,730
that I've been waiting for
all these years.

72
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:08,858
At last some recognition
of my achievements.

73
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:13,738
<i>Dear Monsieur Bernard,
courtesy demands that I inform you</i>

74
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:16,282
<i>of the unfortunate predicament
I find myself in</i>

75
00:10:16,407 --> 00:10:19,369
<i>that prevents me at this time
from observing the custom</i>

76
00:10:19,536 --> 00:10:23,206
<i>requiring that rent be paid,
especially when it's due.</i>

77
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:25,333
<i>Until this morning I had hoped</i>

78
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:29,045
<i>to honor this lo very day
by paying my rent</i> - <i>ah, delusion!</i>

79
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:32,757
<i>As I slept cradled
in false certainty, misfortune -</i>

80
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:35,802
Ananke <i>in Greek - dashed my hopes.</i>

81
00:10:35,927 --> 00:10:38,930
<i>Certain sizable sums I expected
did not materialize,</i>

82
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:43,184
<i>but our beautiful France and I will see
better days - have no doubt of that.</i>

83
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:47,355
<i>The moment we do,
I shall hasten to inform you of it</i>

84
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:51,359
<i>and to remove from my lodgings
my precious possessions,</i>

85
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:55,029
<i>which I leave to your safekeeping
and to that of the law,</i>

86
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:58,825
<i>which restrains you
from selling them for one year.</i>

87
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:01,995
<i>Until then you are at liberty to use</i>

88
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,539
<i>the luxurious lodgings
in which I have resided.</i>

89
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:08,209
<i>In affirmation of my consent,
I hereby affix my signature.</i>

90
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:10,712
<i>Marcel Marx.</i>

91
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:42,869
- Two half orders of trout.
- Yes, sir.

92
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,877
That's a strange order.

93
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:52,629
On the contrary.

94
00:11:52,754 --> 00:11:55,340
This method yields on average

95
00:11:55,465 --> 00:11:58,468
a quarter more
than ordering a full portion.

96
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:12,357
Where is my order?

97
00:12:12,482 --> 00:12:16,069
I'm afraid this gentleman
got the last trout.

98
00:12:21,199 --> 00:12:24,494
May I invite you to partake
of this course with me?

99
00:12:24,661 --> 00:12:27,664
I would not deprive you
of what is yours, sir.

100
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:32,168
Then you'd deprive me of the pleasure
of expressing my goodwill?

101
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:35,296
In that case, sir...

102
00:12:42,345 --> 00:12:45,139
Permit me to refrain
from serving you the head.

103
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:47,600
That I couldn't allow.

104
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:51,354
For if the head is
man's noblest appendage,

105
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:55,108
it's the most unpleasant
part of a trout.

106
00:12:57,026 --> 00:13:00,280
Two heads! This trout is bicephalic,

107
00:13:00,405 --> 00:13:03,032
a word which comes from the Greek

108
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:04,951
and means...

109
00:13:05,076 --> 00:13:07,120
precisely that.

110
00:13:08,538 --> 00:13:12,375
Nevertheless, I harbor no regrets
about eating this phenomenon.

111
00:13:21,384 --> 00:13:23,386
The sauce was delicious.

112
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:25,054
True.

113
00:13:25,388 --> 00:13:28,099
It was prepared
in the province of Béarn,

114
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:31,311
and its fine reputation
is richly deserved.

115
00:13:31,436 --> 00:13:34,355
You seem very learned.
You're not from here?

116
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,648
No.

117
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:37,734
I come from Albania

118
00:13:38,401 --> 00:13:41,195
and have lived in Paris
only three years now.

119
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:44,198
Yet you've already
mastered our language.

120
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:47,785
My nursemaid was French,
from Barcelona.

121
00:13:48,745 --> 00:13:50,747
My name is Rodolfo,

122
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:52,707
and I'm a painter.

123
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:54,959
Marcel Marx, writer.

124
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:57,420
May I offer you a bottle of wine?

125
00:13:57,545 --> 00:13:59,797
Only on one condition:

126
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:03,384
that I see to the coffee and the rest.

127
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:07,263
As a painter, don't you think

128
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:09,766
that Malevich's <i>Black</i> Square

129
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:12,185
is as lethal a blow to painting

130
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:14,062
as the school of Vienna -

131
00:14:14,187 --> 00:14:17,482
Schoenberg, Berg, Webern,
and the rest - is to music?

132
00:14:17,607 --> 00:14:20,276
- I agree entirely.
- Let's go.

133
00:14:32,455 --> 00:14:34,582
I live just around the corner.

134
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:36,793
We may continue our discussion there.

135
00:14:40,797 --> 00:14:43,049
“I floated down impassive rivers,

136
00:14:43,174 --> 00:14:45,551
unguided now by bargemen's hands.

137
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:48,179
Howling natives
had hauled them up for targets

138
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:50,807
and nailed them naked
to painted stakes.”

139
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:52,975
Beautiful stuff, Rimbaud.

140
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:58,314
He and Verlaine
argued vehemently about -

141
00:14:58,481 --> 00:15:01,401
Anyway, come inside.

142
00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:05,113
This is where I live.

143
00:15:12,537 --> 00:15:14,831
Strange. The key's in the lock,

144
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:17,708
though I put it
in my pocket this morning -

145
00:15:21,212 --> 00:15:23,297
where it remains even now.

146
00:15:24,465 --> 00:15:27,218
It's witchcraft! Two keys.

147
00:15:29,846 --> 00:15:33,516
Someone's playing the violin.
These aren't my lodgings.

148
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:57,206
May I help you?

149
00:15:57,331 --> 00:16:00,668
I was mistaken.
This isn't my apartment.

150
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:03,963
I beg your pardon
on my friend's behalf.

151
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:06,048
He's exceptionally drunk.

152
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:07,717
Wait, this is my place.

153
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:10,845
That's my finery!

154
00:16:14,015 --> 00:16:15,725
And what's this?

155
00:16:15,892 --> 00:16:17,602
My Turkish slippers,

156
00:16:17,727 --> 00:16:20,271
given to me by beloved hands!

157
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:28,404
“Marcel Marx is hereby obligated
to vacate the premises

158
00:16:28,571 --> 00:16:30,865
by noon on February eighth...”

159
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:33,868
Am I not the Marcel Marx

160
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:36,454
whom the landlord evicted?

161
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:39,999
The situation is as follows.

162
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:41,667
By law

163
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:43,669
the premises are mine,

164
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:47,840
for you were evicted,
and I paid in advance.

165
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:51,177
Yes, for the premises,
but not the furnishings.

166
00:16:51,302 --> 00:16:53,262
If I pay up,
I may remove them legally -

167
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:56,057
or even illegally, if it were possible.

168
00:16:56,182 --> 00:17:00,019
Thus you have furnishings
but no lodgings,

169
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:03,648
and I have lodgings but no furniture.
- Precisely.

170
00:17:03,773 --> 00:17:05,399
I like the apartment.

171
00:17:05,525 --> 00:17:08,569
And I've never liked it more.
- Pardon?

172
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:11,322
Never as much as now,
and I know what I'm saying.

173
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:14,408
What do you say
we lubricate this explanation?

174
00:17:25,962 --> 00:17:28,130
What an amazing pipe you have.

175
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:32,677
I have an even more handsome one
for use in high society.

176
00:17:32,802 --> 00:17:35,221
Would you care to try it?
- With pleasure.

177
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:39,725
You appear to be a man of musical bent.

178
00:17:40,101 --> 00:17:41,769
A composer.

179
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:44,814
I'm writing a piece called

180
00:17:44,939 --> 00:17:49,443
“The Influence of Blue on the Arts.”

181
00:20:31,522 --> 00:20:34,984
- I can't see anyone just now.
- Why not?

182
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:36,986
Good morning.

183
00:20:38,362 --> 00:20:40,114
Good morning, mademoiselle.

184
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:43,033
- There's my answer.
- I understand.

185
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:47,580
All the same, perhaps
you might lend me 1,000 francs.

186
00:20:47,705 --> 00:20:49,832
I'm all out of paint,

187
00:20:49,999 --> 00:20:53,335
and I can't complete my masterpiece.

188
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:56,589
You're asking a lot.
I'm broke at the moment.

189
00:20:56,714 --> 00:20:59,258
Couldn't you borrow it from the girl?

190
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:03,137
I couldn't do that.
We just met yesterday.

191
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:06,098
- And Schaunard?
- No one's seen him all week.

192
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:07,683
Good-bye.

193
00:21:15,858 --> 00:21:17,526
Where are you going?

194
00:21:17,735 --> 00:21:19,361
To your place...

195
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:21,864
to collect what you owe me.

196
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:24,867
You won't find me at home.

197
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:29,371
I can't pay you back today.
I'm waiting for a girl.

198
00:21:31,665 --> 00:21:34,627
But you can pawn my ring.

199
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:38,798
There she is.

200
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:40,800
Beat it.

201
00:21:55,815 --> 00:21:57,942
What if she comes back to you?

202
00:21:58,234 --> 00:22:00,569
You'd no longer have the ring.

203
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,656
She won't come back.

204
00:22:03,781 --> 00:22:06,492
She ran off with an American.

205
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:09,328
He had a Cadillac.

206
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:11,455
It's a shame about the children.

207
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:13,582
She left them with me,

208
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:17,044
and I don't have enough to feed them.

209
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:20,631
They cry out from hunger in the night.

210
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:22,383
How old are they?

211
00:22:22,508 --> 00:22:23,592
Fourteen...

212
00:22:23,717 --> 00:22:24,969
nine...

213
00:22:25,094 --> 00:22:27,179
seven... six...

214
00:22:27,304 --> 00:22:28,222
three... two...

215
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:29,431
one...

216
00:22:29,557 --> 00:22:31,433
and the youngest is just six months.

217
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,477
So many!

218
00:22:33,644 --> 00:22:36,438
We were young and in love.

219
00:22:37,398 --> 00:22:39,275
It was spring.

220
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,786
You look strange.

221
00:24:13,994 --> 00:24:15,913
What's the matter?

222
00:24:16,872 --> 00:24:19,541
I think I have fallen in love.

223
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:22,044
With whom?

224
00:24:22,252 --> 00:24:24,088
I don't know...

225
00:24:24,213 --> 00:24:26,507
but she's sitting over there.

226
00:24:27,549 --> 00:24:29,718
She's not bad-looking.

227
00:24:30,594 --> 00:24:32,763
Why don't you do something?

228
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:37,059
What if she rejects me?

229
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:40,062
I'd never get over it.

230
00:24:42,606 --> 00:24:45,109
It's our custom in Albania to first -

231
00:24:45,234 --> 00:24:46,944
You stay here.

232
00:24:47,987 --> 00:24:51,699
I'll go speak to her on your behalf.

233
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:56,787
I will awaken in her heart a passion...

234
00:24:57,413 --> 00:24:59,164
for you.

235
00:24:59,415 --> 00:25:01,625
I will lie

236
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:03,752
shamelessly.

237
00:25:10,092 --> 00:25:11,677
Good evening.

238
00:25:12,219 --> 00:25:14,346
See that man over there?

239
00:25:14,471 --> 00:25:17,433
He is in love with you.

240
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:24,606
But so am I.

241
00:25:57,014 --> 00:26:00,059
Excuse me. Can I help you?

242
00:26:00,184 --> 00:26:01,852
I fell asleep.

243
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:03,103
Where are you going?

244
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:04,480
Nowhere.

245
00:26:04,605 --> 00:26:07,775
I arrived in town,
but my girlfriend isn't in.

246
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:09,777
I was to stay with her.

247
00:26:09,902 --> 00:26:11,945
It's no use waiting.

248
00:26:12,071 --> 00:26:15,199
She was taken to prison,
for three years.

249
00:26:22,498 --> 00:26:24,500
What am I going to do now?

250
00:26:24,625 --> 00:26:28,629
I arrived today from Rouen.
I don't know anyone here.

251
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:31,173
If you like...

252
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:33,884
I live next door.

253
00:26:34,802 --> 00:26:38,013
Tell me: Are you
a proper French gentleman?

254
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:39,306
No.

255
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:41,600
I mean, yes...

256
00:26:41,725 --> 00:26:43,685
but I'm not French.

257
00:26:43,811 --> 00:26:45,479
I'm Albanian.

258
00:26:46,105 --> 00:26:47,981
That Will do.

259
00:27:22,432 --> 00:27:25,227
I'm going now
and taking the dog with me.

260
00:27:25,352 --> 00:27:28,689
He sometimes makes noise
at night due to nightmares.

261
00:27:28,814 --> 00:27:30,440
But why?

262
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:32,985
I can sleep on the sofa.

263
00:27:33,193 --> 00:27:35,195
It's too hard for a bed.

264
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,738
And besides...

265
00:27:36,864 --> 00:27:38,907
I'm hot-blooded,

266
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:41,243
and you are very beautiful.

267
00:27:41,743 --> 00:27:44,454
- Where will you go?
- To a friend's.

268
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:46,582
He lives close by.

269
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:50,335
Sleep peacefully.

270
00:27:50,586 --> 00:27:53,046
I'll be back in the morning.

271
00:28:38,175 --> 00:28:39,676
Baudelaire.

272
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:26,014
“I have gone to seek lodgings.
Thank you for your kindness. Mimi.”

273
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:26,908
Where's your black coat?

274
00:30:27,034 --> 00:30:28,744
Can't you see?

275
00:30:30,871 --> 00:30:32,789
You've ruined it.

276
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,958
I'm lost.

277
00:30:37,127 --> 00:30:39,546
I've been summoned by Gassot,
the newspaper czar.

278
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:42,507
He's founding a fashion magazine,
<i>The Sash of Iris,</i>

279
00:30:42,632 --> 00:30:44,760
and plans to make me editor in chief.

280
00:30:44,926 --> 00:30:48,055
If I show up in this getup,
he may change his mind.

281
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:50,932
You can't accept his offer anyway.

282
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:54,603
Gassot is a supporter of the right.

283
00:30:54,936 --> 00:30:57,522
Your principles
won't allow you to eat bread

284
00:30:57,647 --> 00:30:59,941
bathed in the sweat of the people.
- You're mistaken.

285
00:31:00,108 --> 00:31:02,736
He's in the left flank
of the right wing in Parliament.

286
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:05,155
Just yesterday he voted
for widows' pensions.

287
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:09,159
Besides, he knows influential people
whom I'll convince to commission

288
00:31:09,284 --> 00:31:12,579
compositions from you
and portraits from Rodolfo.

289
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:14,456
That changes everything.

290
00:31:14,623 --> 00:31:16,958
What time's your meeting?

291
00:31:18,627 --> 00:31:20,796
At 5100.

292
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:25,717
There's no time to lose.

293
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:29,429
I can polish my shoes black

294
00:31:29,554 --> 00:31:31,848
so no one will notice

295
00:31:31,973 --> 00:31:34,935
that one is round-toed
and the other pointed.

296
00:31:36,603 --> 00:31:39,189
I need a black coat!

297
00:31:39,481 --> 00:31:43,735
I'd give ten years of my life
and my right hand for one.

298
00:31:43,944 --> 00:31:46,988
- Is Rodolfo the painter in?
- That's me.

299
00:31:47,155 --> 00:31:49,908
My cousin recommends
your reasonably priced portraits.

300
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:52,494
I'm told they're very good likenesses.

301
00:31:53,787 --> 00:31:55,705
More accurate than photographs.

302
00:31:55,831 --> 00:31:57,582
He's very talented.

303
00:31:57,707 --> 00:31:59,709
He won every award at school.

304
00:31:59,835 --> 00:32:02,796
My son won an award,
and he's only seven.

305
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:04,297
A talented child.

306
00:32:04,423 --> 00:32:06,425
This portrait you want, Monsieur...

307
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:09,553
Blancheron, from Nantes.
I'm a sugar producer.

308
00:32:09,678 --> 00:32:12,556
I've even written books on the subject.

309
00:32:12,681 --> 00:32:16,518
I'd like a medium-sized portrait.

310
00:32:16,643 --> 00:32:19,104
Like that one. Who is that of?

311
00:32:19,229 --> 00:32:20,939
My mother.

312
00:32:21,064 --> 00:32:23,233
How much would one of that size cost?

313
00:32:23,358 --> 00:32:25,527
Between 1,000 and 1,200 francs,

314
00:32:25,652 --> 00:32:28,029
depending on whether your hands show.

315
00:32:28,196 --> 00:32:31,074
- My cousin said 500.
- It depends on the season.

316
00:32:31,199 --> 00:32:33,910
Paint prices vary with the season.

317
00:32:34,035 --> 00:32:37,330
- Interesting. Just like sugar.
- Precisely.

318
00:32:37,456 --> 00:32:40,542
- Paint me one for 1,000 francs.
- You're making a mistake.

319
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:44,713
For 200 more, he'll paint your hands
holding your book on sugar.

320
00:32:44,838 --> 00:32:48,341
You simply must do it.
- Would that look good?

321
00:32:48,467 --> 00:32:50,260
Exceptionally good.

322
00:32:50,385 --> 00:32:52,721
Is the portrait for your home?

323
00:32:52,846 --> 00:32:54,431
Yes, the living room.

324
00:32:54,556 --> 00:32:57,476
Then you must be in a dressing gown.

325
00:32:59,269 --> 00:33:01,313
Please sit in this chair.

326
00:33:03,273 --> 00:33:05,275
Take off your coat.

327
00:33:09,029 --> 00:33:11,072
I don't have a dressing gown with me.

328
00:33:11,198 --> 00:33:12,657
Don't worry.

329
00:33:12,782 --> 00:33:15,202
My friend will lend you his.

330
00:33:24,503 --> 00:33:28,548
Marcel, please hang up
the gentleman's coat.

331
00:33:29,716 --> 00:33:32,886
How unfortunate.
I'll be late for supper.

332
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:36,973
The restaurant downstairs
will send up anything we want.

333
00:33:37,641 --> 00:33:40,060
I'll go order something.

334
00:33:53,949 --> 00:33:58,620
I have several ideas to improve
the contents of your magazine.

335
00:33:58,787 --> 00:34:02,999
For instance, one could -
this is just one possibility -

336
00:34:03,124 --> 00:34:05,252
one could publish a play,

337
00:34:05,377 --> 00:34:08,797
and on the facing pages
show the characters

338
00:34:08,964 --> 00:34:12,634
dressed in a certain way
as if it were the fashion -

339
00:34:12,801 --> 00:34:14,636
the latest fashion, of course.

340
00:34:14,761 --> 00:34:16,846
One could also envision

341
00:34:16,972 --> 00:34:19,766
other things, like, for example,

342
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:23,687
publishing the works of Baudelaire

343
00:34:23,812 --> 00:34:25,855
in serial form -

344
00:34:39,536 --> 00:34:41,496
<i>When may I come for it?</i>

345
00:34:41,663 --> 00:34:45,041
I'll finish it tomorrow
and bring it to you.

346
00:34:46,126 --> 00:34:50,171
I'd prefer to pay at once
so as not to remain in debt to you.

347
00:34:50,797 --> 00:34:53,383
We're alike in that respect.

348
00:34:53,508 --> 00:34:56,678
My cash is at the hotel.
You'll have it tomorrow.

349
00:34:56,845 --> 00:34:59,764
Now, if you'd get me my coat...

350
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:14,279
It was very dusty,
so I had it laundered.

351
00:35:14,404 --> 00:35:16,781
They only charged 40 francs.

352
00:35:16,906 --> 00:35:19,242
Just add it to my bill.

353
00:35:42,641 --> 00:35:44,851
I'm not paying a thing!

354
00:35:51,066 --> 00:35:52,651
Shit!

355
00:35:58,490 --> 00:35:59,699
The swine!

356
00:35:59,824 --> 00:36:02,535
He wanted to charge me

357
00:36:02,744 --> 00:36:04,704
for a few miles.

358
00:36:11,503 --> 00:36:13,755
There must be 60,000 francs there.

359
00:36:13,922 --> 00:36:16,341
15,240, to be precise -

360
00:36:16,466 --> 00:36:20,845
an advance for producing
a sample issue of The Sash of Iris.

361
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:23,264
Here's my plan.

362
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:25,642
Secure from life's material woes,

363
00:36:25,767 --> 00:36:28,061
I intend to go about this seriously.

364
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:31,272
First I'll get rid of these rags
and dress decently

365
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:34,109
so that the fashion salons
will take me seriously.

366
00:36:34,275 --> 00:36:36,194
If you'll follow my example,

367
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:39,406
I can hire you
as door-to-door ad salesmen.

368
00:36:39,531 --> 00:36:43,451
Until then, let a strict economy
govern our lives.

369
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,246
I accept wholeheartedly.

370
00:36:46,371 --> 00:36:48,164
But to start with,

371
00:36:48,289 --> 00:36:51,126
give me a couple of thousand francs.

372
00:36:51,251 --> 00:36:52,293
Why?

373
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:56,965
As a door-to-door salesman,
I must have a car

374
00:36:58,007 --> 00:37:02,637
to call on potential advertisers
in the provinces.

375
00:37:03,304 --> 00:37:04,848
That's true.

376
00:37:05,765 --> 00:37:07,851
Shall we order a table?

377
00:37:07,976 --> 00:37:11,396
Yes. Then I can tell you
more about my new job.

378
00:37:12,564 --> 00:37:16,443
There's an excellent restaurant
not far from here.

379
00:37:16,568 --> 00:37:18,528
It's a bit expensive,

380
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:22,615
but we'll make it up
in the time we save.

381
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:25,410
Very well, but starting tomorrow

382
00:37:25,535 --> 00:37:28,663
we shall devise even greater
means of economizing.

383
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:33,168
No more eating out.
We'll hire a woman to cook for us.

384
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:36,296
It would be wiser
to take on a manservant

385
00:37:36,421 --> 00:37:38,631
who could then double as cook.

386
00:37:38,757 --> 00:37:41,509
Our household would be
in impeccable order

387
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:44,012
and we'd have much more time to work

388
00:37:44,137 --> 00:37:48,683
with him to shine our shoes
and see to our errands.

389
00:37:48,808 --> 00:37:51,895
Then we'll need larger accommodations.

390
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:54,606
That, in any case, is unavoidable

391
00:37:54,731 --> 00:37:59,527
if we mean to live in keeping
with our new position in society.

392
00:38:05,575 --> 00:38:07,410
I'll be back.

393
00:38:18,588 --> 00:38:21,090
A pack of Celtiques, please.

394
00:38:24,636 --> 00:38:26,262
Good evening, Mimi.

395
00:38:26,387 --> 00:38:28,389
You found work.

396
00:38:29,098 --> 00:38:30,975
As you can see.

397
00:38:31,226 --> 00:38:34,896
- And a place to live?
- It comes with the job.

398
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:37,690
Are you going to the nightclub?

399
00:38:39,234 --> 00:38:41,486
I just came along with my friends.

400
00:38:41,611 --> 00:38:43,571
I don't care for modern music.

401
00:38:43,738 --> 00:38:46,032
I'm going to have a drink.

402
00:38:49,911 --> 00:38:51,913
A glass of water, please.

403
00:39:12,433 --> 00:39:15,270
<i>- Who was that?
- A regular.</i>

404
00:39:15,395 --> 00:39:17,730
He has the manners of a peasant.

405
00:39:37,125 --> 00:39:39,586
It's kind of you to see me home,

406
00:39:39,711 --> 00:39:42,255
but this is nowhere near where I live.

407
00:39:45,675 --> 00:39:47,844
I wish you lived in Moscow

408
00:39:47,969 --> 00:39:51,764
so I might have your company
that much longer.

409
00:39:52,682 --> 00:39:54,642
That's a bit too far.

410
00:39:56,311 --> 00:39:58,771
We could take the boulevard.

411
00:40:01,566 --> 00:40:03,276
Fancy that.

412
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:07,989
We've arrived by chance where I live.

413
00:40:09,157 --> 00:40:12,911
Wouldn't you like to come up
and say hello to the dog?

414
00:40:13,995 --> 00:40:16,789
Very well, but just for a moment.

415
00:40:16,915 --> 00:40:18,958
I'll make some coffee.

416
00:40:19,167 --> 00:40:20,919
In the meanwhile,

417
00:40:21,044 --> 00:40:23,671
you may enjoy
the city view from my window.

418
00:40:30,511 --> 00:40:32,055
They wilted.

419
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:35,099
Had I known, I'd have bought

420
00:40:35,224 --> 00:40:37,018
plastic flowers.

421
00:40:42,815 --> 00:40:44,651
What's his name?

422
00:40:44,776 --> 00:40:46,277
Baudelaire.

423
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:53,201
I'm out of coffee,

424
00:40:53,368 --> 00:40:55,411
but I'll make some soup.

425
00:41:54,595 --> 00:41:56,764
May I kiss your hand?

426
00:42:01,102 --> 00:42:02,937
You move fast.

427
00:42:03,271 --> 00:42:06,441
The sooner to reach the goal.

428
00:42:49,358 --> 00:42:51,360
How much is this?

429
00:42:51,486 --> 00:42:53,529
A hundred francs.

430
00:42:55,031 --> 00:42:56,532
Fifty.

431
00:42:57,784 --> 00:43:00,161
All right. For you, 50.

432
00:43:06,334 --> 00:43:08,169
How about this?

433
00:44:30,459 --> 00:44:32,670
I live with two other girls.

434
00:44:33,421 --> 00:44:35,423
They have a male friend in common

435
00:44:35,590 --> 00:44:38,509
whom they're constantly fighting over.

436
00:44:38,634 --> 00:44:40,428
I don't get it.

437
00:44:40,636 --> 00:44:42,263
The man is stupid

438
00:44:42,388 --> 00:44:45,266
and ugly, and married to boot.

439
00:44:45,433 --> 00:44:47,101
Uglier than me?

440
00:44:47,226 --> 00:44:48,936
There's no comparison.

441
00:44:49,061 --> 00:44:51,564
Next to him, you're Lino Ventura.

442
00:44:51,689 --> 00:44:53,274
Who's that?

443
00:44:53,399 --> 00:44:56,485
An Italian movie star.
You don't know him?

444
00:44:56,944 --> 00:44:58,487
Forget him.

445
00:44:58,613 --> 00:45:00,448
Let's talk about me.

446
00:45:00,615 --> 00:45:02,992
Why not...

447
00:45:03,409 --> 00:45:05,369
move in with me?

448
00:45:06,287 --> 00:45:08,998
I'm against marriage in principle,

449
00:45:09,999 --> 00:45:13,127
but we could make an exception.

450
00:45:13,294 --> 00:45:15,463
You'll stop working.

451
00:45:15,588 --> 00:45:18,424
I'll support us both with my paintings.

452
00:45:18,799 --> 00:45:21,302
And what would I do?

453
00:45:22,345 --> 00:45:26,182
You'd walk Baudelaire,
clean the place -

454
00:45:26,307 --> 00:45:27,975
that sort of thing.

455
00:45:28,142 --> 00:45:29,852
Are you serious?

456
00:45:30,937 --> 00:45:32,897
I'll clean...

457
00:45:33,022 --> 00:45:36,943
and you can look
out the window at the park.

458
00:45:37,068 --> 00:45:39,654
In the evenings we'll go to the opera.

459
00:45:58,839 --> 00:46:01,008
My wallet's been stolen.

460
00:46:02,343 --> 00:46:04,345
Do you have any money?

461
00:46:04,762 --> 00:46:06,430
Just a few francs.

462
00:46:31,122 --> 00:46:32,581
Police?

463
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:41,507
Your passport.

464
00:46:56,981 --> 00:46:59,734
Listen, how much is their check?

465
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:01,569
Four hundred twenty.

466
00:47:02,361 --> 00:47:04,822
Will you allow me to pay it?

467
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:09,076
You think you'll get your money
back from that burn?

468
00:47:09,201 --> 00:47:11,203
It doesn't matter.

469
00:47:11,454 --> 00:47:14,790
Then as far as we're concerned,
the matter is settled.

470
00:47:20,421 --> 00:47:22,423
I have to go now.

471
00:47:23,382 --> 00:47:25,634
I start work at 9:00.

472
00:47:27,136 --> 00:47:29,889
I have to wait for my passport.

473
00:47:30,556 --> 00:47:33,100
I'll come by your place
tomorrow evening.

474
00:47:35,436 --> 00:47:37,229
I'll be waiting.

475
00:48:00,586 --> 00:48:02,254
Come with me.

476
00:48:02,588 --> 00:48:04,090
Why?

477
00:48:04,590 --> 00:48:07,176
There's something suspicious
about your papers.

478
00:48:13,933 --> 00:48:17,019
You've resided in France
for three years with no visa,

479
00:48:17,144 --> 00:48:19,814
no residence permit, no work permit.

480
00:48:20,481 --> 00:48:23,484
You claim you came by train from Spain,

481
00:48:23,609 --> 00:48:26,195
but you choose to say nothing more.

482
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:31,283
There is nothing more to say.

483
00:48:31,409 --> 00:48:32,952
Very well.

484
00:48:33,244 --> 00:48:35,538
You'll spend the night here.

485
00:48:36,288 --> 00:48:39,667
We'll decide your fate in the morning.

486
00:48:41,669 --> 00:48:43,671
May I make a call?

487
00:48:43,796 --> 00:48:47,258
My dog is home alone. - In the morning.

488
00:49:32,887 --> 00:49:35,890
You're to be deported
immediately to Albania.

489
00:49:36,557 --> 00:49:39,518
The flight for Athens
leaves in two hours.

490
00:49:39,643 --> 00:49:42,229
If you're found
within France's borders again

491
00:49:42,354 --> 00:49:44,148
without the necessary papers,

492
00:49:44,273 --> 00:49:47,568
it will mean six months in jail.

493
00:49:48,777 --> 00:49:51,906
May I make a call now?

494
00:49:52,198 --> 00:49:53,991
Make it fast.

495
00:50:00,998 --> 00:50:03,375
Mimi hasn't arrived yet.

496
00:50:04,251 --> 00:50:05,920
I don't know.

497
00:50:07,922 --> 00:50:10,299
Try again in a couple of hours.

498
00:50:13,594 --> 00:50:15,387
Morning, Henri.

499
00:50:15,513 --> 00:50:17,306
- Someone just called for you.
- Who?

500
00:50:17,431 --> 00:50:18,849
He didn't say.

501
00:50:18,974 --> 00:50:20,976
Could you make me a coffee?

502
00:50:30,736 --> 00:50:31,987
<i>Listen...</i>

503
00:50:32,112 --> 00:50:34,114
I'm being deported.

504
00:50:34,907 --> 00:50:38,118
Will you look after Baudelaire
and my paintings?

505
00:50:39,787 --> 00:50:41,830
I won't be coming back.

506
00:50:43,624 --> 00:50:47,127
They'll put me in jail if I do.

507
00:50:48,003 --> 00:50:49,129
Understand?

508
00:50:53,759 --> 00:50:55,553
Good-bye, Rodolfo.

509
00:50:59,974 --> 00:51:01,976
- A Suze.
- Problems?

510
00:51:02,101 --> 00:51:03,852
No. Just thirsty.

511
00:51:38,512 --> 00:51:40,514
What do you think?

512
00:51:40,973 --> 00:51:42,391
1,800 francs.

513
00:51:42,516 --> 00:51:46,145
Only 19,000 miles. It has brakes...

514
00:51:47,438 --> 00:51:49,106
and everything.

515
00:51:50,149 --> 00:51:51,567
Great.

516
00:51:51,692 --> 00:51:53,777
Are you free this evening?

517
00:51:54,236 --> 00:51:57,531
What's bothering you?
You don't seem too enthusiastic.

518
00:51:57,656 --> 00:52:00,367
Rodolfds been deported. No papers.

519
00:52:01,368 --> 00:52:02,578
Shit.

520
00:52:02,703 --> 00:52:04,538
I'll go get Baudelaire.

521
00:52:04,705 --> 00:52:08,042
Let's meet there tonight and haul
his paintings to your place.

522
00:52:08,167 --> 00:52:09,710
All right.

523
00:52:31,565 --> 00:52:33,233
Evening, ma'am.

524
00:52:53,754 --> 00:52:56,799
- Are you looking for Rodolfo?
- Yes.

525
00:52:56,924 --> 00:52:59,760
We were to meet here. Where is he?

526
00:53:00,094 --> 00:53:03,263
He's been deported.
He was in the country illegally.

527
00:53:03,430 --> 00:53:04,682
When?

528
00:53:04,807 --> 00:53:06,141
This afternoon.

529
00:53:06,266 --> 00:53:08,268
Is he coming back?

530
00:53:08,977 --> 00:53:10,646
I don't know.

531
00:53:11,814 --> 00:53:13,315
I have to go.

532
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:15,776
Shut the door when you leave.

533
00:53:45,806 --> 00:53:48,976
SPRING

534
00:54:43,739 --> 00:54:46,325
Hello, Musette. How's it going?

535
00:54:47,117 --> 00:54:49,119
What's it look like?

536
00:54:51,079 --> 00:54:52,873
How many today?

537
00:54:52,998 --> 00:54:55,334
We have to go to press Friday.

538
00:54:55,459 --> 00:54:58,754
Just one, but a full page.
For Printemps.

539
00:54:58,879 --> 00:55:01,965
I know. They called and cancelled it.

540
00:55:02,090 --> 00:55:06,720
Coffee originated in Arabia,
where it was discovered by a goat.

541
00:55:06,845 --> 00:55:10,891
Balzac drank 70 cups a day.

542
00:55:11,183 --> 00:55:13,936
What are you up to with that ladder?

543
00:55:14,895 --> 00:55:17,856
It's the link between me
and my beloved.

544
00:55:17,981 --> 00:55:20,067
Have you read Shakespeare?

545
00:55:20,234 --> 00:55:23,195
Of course. He was a great philosopher.

546
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:26,865
Do you remember <i>Romeo and Juliet?</i>

547
00:55:27,241 --> 00:55:29,201
Do I remember it?

548
00:55:29,326 --> 00:55:31,995
“It was the nightingale
and not the lark

549
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:36,375
that pierced
the fearful hollow of thine ear.”

550
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:38,627
Don't you understand?

551
00:55:39,044 --> 00:55:41,672
I've met a girl from a good family,

552
00:55:41,797 --> 00:55:45,092
but for certain reasons
her father can't stand me

553
00:55:45,259 --> 00:55:47,386
and has threatened to kill me.

554
00:55:47,511 --> 00:55:49,513
The girl's name is Juliette,

555
00:55:49,638 --> 00:55:52,766
and her room just happens
to have a balcony.

556
00:55:52,891 --> 00:55:55,477
I came to borrow this bird

557
00:55:55,602 --> 00:55:59,606
to wake me every morning
before the old man gets up.

558
00:56:00,357 --> 00:56:04,111
I'd be obliged
if from now on you'd call me

559
00:56:04,278 --> 00:56:06,405
Romeo Montague.

560
00:56:07,614 --> 00:56:09,783
What do you think of my plan?

561
00:56:13,871 --> 00:56:16,290
<i>The Sash of Iris,</i> hello.

562
00:56:17,749 --> 00:56:20,127
It's for you, Marcel, from abroad.

563
00:56:25,382 --> 00:56:26,884
All right.

564
00:56:28,427 --> 00:56:29,970
Where?

565
00:56:31,263 --> 00:56:32,764
What time?

566
00:56:35,309 --> 00:56:36,810
Very well.

567
00:56:38,020 --> 00:56:40,647
Forget about your Juliette.
We have to go.

568
00:56:40,814 --> 00:56:42,649
- Where?
- The border.

569
00:56:42,816 --> 00:56:44,818
I'll explain on the way.

570
00:56:47,112 --> 00:56:50,365
Let me have a few hundred.
- There is no money.

571
00:56:50,490 --> 00:56:51,992
Where did it all go?

572
00:56:52,159 --> 00:56:54,745
I paid the printer
so they'd give me the magazines.

573
00:56:54,870 --> 00:56:56,872
You could have left them there.

574
00:56:56,997 --> 00:56:59,374
We need a picture for the cover.

575
00:57:09,593 --> 00:57:11,094
Hold still.

576
00:57:19,811 --> 00:57:21,396
Now let's go.

577
00:58:12,072 --> 00:58:13,407
There he is.

578
00:58:47,691 --> 00:58:51,111
Shall we go?
We can make Paris by morning.

579
01:00:51,439 --> 01:00:54,317
- When is Mimi in?
- Mimi isn't here anymore.

580
01:00:54,442 --> 01:00:57,070
But they stop in almost every evening.

581
01:00:57,237 --> 01:00:58,488
Who's “they”?

582
01:00:58,613 --> 01:01:02,117
Mimi and Francis, her boyfriend.
Why do you ask?

583
01:01:02,909 --> 01:01:04,911
I'm an old friend.

584
01:01:06,371 --> 01:01:07,664
Thank you.

585
01:01:52,834 --> 01:01:54,419
Good evening.

586
01:01:54,544 --> 01:01:56,254
How are you?
- Fine.

587
01:01:56,379 --> 01:01:58,381
Someone was asking for you.
- Who?

588
01:01:58,506 --> 01:02:01,134
An old friend. He's sitting over there.

589
01:03:27,345 --> 01:03:30,015
I believe The Crossing of the Red Sea

590
01:03:30,140 --> 01:03:31,766
is finished.

591
01:03:32,225 --> 01:03:34,019
I feel empty.

592
01:03:34,311 --> 01:03:38,273
If you manage to sell it,
we can pay the rent.

593
01:03:38,940 --> 01:03:41,776
Perhaps you could
come down on the price.

594
01:03:42,610 --> 01:03:45,447
I won't sell it for less

595
01:03:45,572 --> 01:03:47,198
than 200 francs.

596
01:03:47,324 --> 01:03:49,743
I've already put

597
01:03:49,909 --> 01:03:52,787
over 10,000 francs'
worth of paint into it.

598
01:03:52,912 --> 01:03:55,415
What if the landlord calls the police?

599
01:03:55,540 --> 01:03:58,335
You still don't have
a residence permit.

600
01:03:59,711 --> 01:04:01,588
Come in.

601
01:04:16,519 --> 01:04:18,271
What a surprise.

602
01:04:21,608 --> 01:04:25,362
Would you offer our guest
a glass of water?

603
01:04:29,074 --> 01:04:30,950
To what do I owe this honor?

604
01:04:31,076 --> 01:04:33,078
I was so inspired by your portrait

605
01:04:33,203 --> 01:04:36,122
that I've decided
to become a collector.

606
01:04:36,289 --> 01:04:39,334
I'm now looking
for a relatively large painting,

607
01:04:39,793 --> 01:04:41,628
and I thought of you.

608
01:04:41,753 --> 01:04:43,463
You're in luck.

609
01:04:43,630 --> 01:04:47,801
I just finished this one
and intended to send it off

610
01:04:47,926 --> 01:04:50,678
in the morning with some other works

611
01:04:50,804 --> 01:04:53,348
to an exhibition in New York.

612
01:04:53,640 --> 01:04:56,601
But if you'd care to make an offer...

613
01:04:57,227 --> 01:04:59,479
as an old customer...

614
01:05:00,814 --> 01:05:03,024
I like the work very much.

615
01:05:03,525 --> 01:05:05,819
I'll give you 1,000 francs.

616
01:05:06,986 --> 01:05:09,072
- You're joking.
- 1,200.

617
01:05:09,197 --> 01:05:10,365
2,000.

618
01:05:10,490 --> 01:05:11,991
1,400.

619
01:05:12,117 --> 01:05:13,910
1,700.

620
01:05:14,327 --> 01:05:16,162
1,500...

621
01:05:17,705 --> 01:05:20,542
and two tickets
to the opera this evening.

622
01:05:22,627 --> 01:05:26,381
Opera is a dying art form,
but all right.

623
01:05:45,775 --> 01:05:48,987
Go pay the rent and then get dressed.

624
01:05:49,779 --> 01:05:52,490
You and Musette can go to the opera.

625
01:05:57,662 --> 01:05:59,873
I'll wait outside.

626
01:06:00,498 --> 01:06:03,042
I have to talk to Marcel.

627
01:06:59,307 --> 01:07:01,226
Poor girls.

628
01:07:01,351 --> 01:07:04,229
They were never meant
to live like this.

629
01:07:05,271 --> 01:07:08,608
Being men, and thus stronger
in every respect,

630
01:07:08,775 --> 01:07:11,528
we bear up joyfully
under every misfortune.

631
01:07:11,653 --> 01:07:13,696
We don't sink into depression

632
01:07:13,821 --> 01:07:17,283
if our outfit isn't always
neat and tidy.

633
01:07:17,450 --> 01:07:20,328
But for women it's different.

634
01:07:20,954 --> 01:07:25,333
The simplest frock brings them joy,
and one can't fault them for that.

635
01:07:25,583 --> 01:07:27,168
On the other hand,

636
01:07:27,293 --> 01:07:31,548
the market for art and literature
has been bustling recently.

637
01:07:32,757 --> 01:07:34,968
We'll soon be earning

638
01:07:35,134 --> 01:07:38,846
nearly as much as porters
at the Gare de L'Est.

639
01:07:38,972 --> 01:07:40,515
It's true.

640
01:07:41,307 --> 01:07:44,435
Works of art are selling like pancakes.

641
01:07:44,561 --> 01:07:46,145
Then it's agreed.

642
01:07:46,312 --> 01:07:50,316
Tomorrow we take the girls shopping
to indulge their feminine whims.

643
01:07:50,441 --> 01:07:53,653
Sunday we'll go on a picnic
in the countryside.

644
01:07:54,821 --> 01:07:56,364
What about me?

645
01:07:56,489 --> 01:07:59,158
You have two days
to find yourself a companion.

646
01:07:59,284 --> 01:08:03,204
It's not our fault if your appearance
sparks no interest in the opposite sex.

647
01:08:03,329 --> 01:08:06,165
But if you have no luck,
you can still come along...

648
01:08:06,374 --> 01:08:08,042
as our driver.

649
01:08:10,128 --> 01:08:14,048
Monsieur, there's a call
for you in the kitchen.

650
01:08:15,216 --> 01:08:16,676
Madame...

651
01:08:16,843 --> 01:08:20,346
your eyes are like two moons.

652
01:08:33,693 --> 01:08:37,113
Let's hope it doesn't come
to more than 600 francs.

653
01:11:06,679 --> 01:11:08,681
And never come back!

654
01:11:10,516 --> 01:11:12,518
They didn't like it?

655
01:11:13,519 --> 01:11:15,188
Idiots!

656
01:11:15,563 --> 01:11:18,107
They tried to discourage me.

657
01:11:18,232 --> 01:11:21,235
They said I should break
my brushes in two

658
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:23,696
and jump out the window.

659
01:11:27,033 --> 01:11:29,952
Let's go borrow some money from Marcel

660
01:11:30,077 --> 01:11:32,288
and go out to eat.

661
01:11:48,554 --> 01:11:50,306
I gave you

662
01:11:50,431 --> 01:11:53,392
a cash advance.

663
01:11:55,061 --> 01:11:57,647
I want it back

664
01:11:57,772 --> 01:11:59,232
in two days.

665
01:11:59,357 --> 01:12:01,400
Not three or five.

666
01:12:01,567 --> 01:12:03,236
Two days.

667
01:12:04,403 --> 01:12:06,072
Good luck...

668
01:12:07,114 --> 01:12:08,741
and good-bye.

669
01:12:26,592 --> 01:12:28,594
What was that all about?

670
01:12:28,719 --> 01:12:31,138
He's mad that I serialized my play.

671
01:12:31,264 --> 01:12:35,601
Says it didn't suit the magazine's
style and that readers complained.

672
01:12:35,768 --> 01:12:37,436
What readers?

673
01:12:37,603 --> 01:12:40,773
Besides, as editor in chief,
I set the style.

674
01:12:40,940 --> 01:12:43,609
He was just the publisher. Capitalist!

675
01:12:43,776 --> 01:12:45,987
- I'm hungry.
- Me too.

676
01:12:46,696 --> 01:12:48,698
Come eat at my place.

677
01:12:48,865 --> 01:12:51,158
I happen to have a little money.

678
01:12:51,450 --> 01:12:53,077
While we're at it,

679
01:12:53,202 --> 01:12:56,080
I can play my latest
composition for you.

680
01:15:30,109 --> 01:15:32,445
I'm going to leave Marcel.

681
01:15:34,196 --> 01:15:35,781
When?

682
01:15:35,906 --> 01:15:37,575
Tonight.

683
01:15:38,492 --> 01:15:40,453
I've already packed.

684
01:15:42,705 --> 01:15:44,665
Does he know?

685
01:15:47,251 --> 01:15:49,420
I didn't dare tell him.

686
01:15:51,922 --> 01:15:54,091
I'm going back to Strasbourg.

687
01:15:54,383 --> 01:15:56,343
There's this farmer there.

688
01:15:56,469 --> 01:15:59,305
He's not great-looking,
but he's sweet...

689
01:16:00,222 --> 01:16:01,932
and dependable.

690
01:16:03,726 --> 01:16:05,227
Why?

691
01:16:07,063 --> 01:16:09,065
Marcel doesn't need me.

692
01:16:12,651 --> 01:16:14,361
All he loves is his books.

693
01:16:15,863 --> 01:16:19,492
Yesterday I pawned
my ring for rent money.

694
01:16:19,617 --> 01:16:23,621
I left the money on the table.
When I came back, he'd taken it...

695
01:16:24,622 --> 01:16:27,583
and spent it all
on first-edition Balzacs.

696
01:16:27,708 --> 01:16:29,210
Poor Marcel.

697
01:16:31,921 --> 01:16:34,256
He'll forget me in a week.

698
01:16:36,467 --> 01:16:39,512
In any case,
quicker than I'll forget him.

699
01:16:43,140 --> 01:16:45,059
That's how men are.

700
01:16:46,435 --> 01:16:49,563
Will you see me to the station?
- Of course.

701
01:16:49,855 --> 01:16:51,524
I'll miss you.

702
01:16:51,774 --> 01:16:53,734
You must come visit!

703
01:16:53,859 --> 01:16:55,736
I'll send you the fare.

704
01:16:55,861 --> 01:16:57,655
The man's rich.

705
01:16:57,780 --> 01:16:59,782
I promise.

706
01:17:00,324 --> 01:17:02,660
Write to me care of general delivery.

707
01:17:02,993 --> 01:17:04,870
Why general delivery?

708
01:17:06,497 --> 01:17:08,040
I don't know.

709
01:18:13,772 --> 01:18:15,858
How's it going, Mimi?

710
01:18:16,275 --> 01:18:17,568
Fine.

711
01:18:17,693 --> 01:18:19,278
Can I give you a ride?

712
01:18:21,280 --> 01:18:23,365
You can drive me home.

713
01:18:44,136 --> 01:18:45,638
Yes, darling.

714
01:18:46,639 --> 01:18:48,682
I found work.

715
01:18:50,392 --> 01:18:52,728
You needn't have.

716
01:18:52,937 --> 01:18:56,148
I can't go on living like this,
never having any money.

717
01:18:56,273 --> 01:18:58,984
I can't breathe.
It's like I'm suffocating.

718
01:18:59,109 --> 01:19:01,445
I'll open the window.

719
01:19:01,737 --> 01:19:03,364
That won't help.

720
01:19:03,489 --> 01:19:06,033
Besides, it's already cold in here.

721
01:19:07,076 --> 01:19:09,870
Shall I light a fire in the stove?

722
01:19:11,038 --> 01:19:13,499
There's no wood or coal.

723
01:19:24,510 --> 01:19:26,595
Some old poems of mine.

724
01:19:27,304 --> 01:19:30,432
I thought I'd publish a collection...

725
01:19:30,933 --> 01:19:32,559
someday.

726
01:19:54,707 --> 01:19:59,211
At least they'll provide some heat.

727
01:20:02,589 --> 01:20:04,717
I'm going for a little walk.

728
01:20:08,304 --> 01:20:10,556
Don't be too long.

729
01:21:48,695 --> 01:21:50,656
Hello, Rodolfo.

730
01:21:50,781 --> 01:21:52,533
Hello, Mimi.

731
01:21:53,742 --> 01:21:55,828
I love you, you know,

732
01:21:55,994 --> 01:21:58,122
but life is hard.

733
01:21:59,998 --> 01:22:02,793
Yes. I understand.

734
01:22:28,861 --> 01:22:30,863
<i>I drink.</i>

735
01:22:31,196 --> 01:22:33,615
<i>Glass after glass</i>

736
01:22:34,867 --> 01:22:39,079
<i>To forget all about my wife's friends</i>

737
01:22:41,748 --> 01:22:44,418
<i>I drink.</i>

738
01:22:44,543 --> 01:22:46,879
<i>Glass after glass</i>

739
01:22:48,505 --> 01:22:53,844
<i>To forget all my troubles</i>

740
01:22:55,345 --> 01:22:57,806
<i>I drink.</i>

741
01:22:58,182 --> 01:23:01,018
<i>Any old swill</i>

742
01:23:02,060 --> 01:23:07,357
<i>As long as it's strong</i>

743
01:23:08,692 --> 01:23:10,986
<i>I drink.</i>

744
01:23:11,445 --> 01:23:13,822
<i>The cheapest stuff</i>

745
01:23:15,324 --> 01:23:17,576
<i>It's rough</i>

746
01:23:17,743 --> 01:23:20,454
<i>But it passes the time</i>

747
01:23:22,372 --> 01:23:25,417
<i>Is life really such a lark?</i>

748
01:23:25,667 --> 01:23:28,921
<i>Is it really so exciting?</i>

749
01:23:29,046 --> 01:23:32,716
<i>I ask</i>

750
01:23:32,841 --> 01:23:34,510
<i>Those two questions</i>

751
01:23:34,635 --> 01:23:36,595
AUTUMN

752
01:23:36,720 --> 01:23:38,931
<i>Is it worth living?</i>

753
01:23:39,306 --> 01:23:42,684
<i>Or loving, only to be cheated on?</i>

754
01:23:42,809 --> 01:23:45,938
<i>I ask those two questions</i>

755
01:23:47,606 --> 01:23:51,360
<i>But no one ever answers</i>

756
01:23:51,485 --> 01:23:54,238
<i>And so I drink</i>

757
01:23:54,363 --> 01:23:56,615
<i>Glass after glass</i>

758
01:24:10,879 --> 01:24:12,381
What?

759
01:24:13,006 --> 01:24:14,508
Nothing.

760
01:24:32,150 --> 01:24:34,152
It's very good.

761
01:24:38,240 --> 01:24:41,660
The voice of the people
is the voice of God.

762
01:24:41,785 --> 01:24:43,996
EVEN MOSES USED BLANCHERON SUGAR

763
01:24:51,545 --> 01:24:54,881
That there is known as
turkey with truffles.

764
01:24:56,550 --> 01:24:59,344
Look at the color of that leg of lamb!

765
01:24:59,511 --> 01:25:02,139
Lamb is the favorite food of the gods

766
01:25:02,264 --> 01:25:05,183
and also of my godmother,
Madame Chandlier.

767
01:25:06,560 --> 01:25:08,186
And what about those trout?

768
01:25:08,312 --> 01:25:10,439
They're superb swimmers.

769
01:25:10,981 --> 01:25:13,358
They climb rapids as quickly

770
01:25:13,525 --> 01:25:16,862
as we'd accept an invitation
to dinner this evening.

771
01:25:17,029 --> 01:25:19,197
That fruit is known as pineapple.

772
01:25:20,240 --> 01:25:23,035
I almost got to taste one once.

773
01:25:24,244 --> 01:25:26,038
Speaking of fruit,

774
01:25:26,204 --> 01:25:29,207
I wouldn't say no
to that pheasant there.

775
01:25:29,374 --> 01:25:32,169
Why this profusion of delicacies?

776
01:25:32,753 --> 01:25:36,048
You don't know? It's All Saints' Day,

777
01:25:36,840 --> 01:25:39,217
a great family celebration.

778
01:25:39,843 --> 01:25:42,554
Would you care to spend
the evening with me?

779
01:25:43,889 --> 01:25:45,390
No money.

780
01:25:45,599 --> 01:25:47,643
How much have you got?

781
01:26:29,226 --> 01:26:31,728
I don't understand.
I've lost my appetite.

782
01:26:34,439 --> 01:26:35,941
Same here.

783
01:26:39,486 --> 01:26:41,321
I can see

784
01:26:41,446 --> 01:26:45,742
that a phantom from the past
sits at this table.

785
01:26:46,618 --> 01:26:51,373
But if you intend
to waste away to nothing,

786
01:26:51,498 --> 01:26:54,793
you could do so
just as well on a full stomach.

787
01:27:09,558 --> 01:27:11,560
Am I disturbing you?

788
01:27:12,894 --> 01:27:14,354
Come in.

789
01:27:24,823 --> 01:27:26,658
I'm so cold.

790
01:27:27,826 --> 01:27:30,454
I happened to be passing by

791
01:27:30,579 --> 01:27:33,039
and saw the light in the window.

792
01:27:34,541 --> 01:27:37,627
I lost my apartment a week ago,

793
01:27:37,753 --> 01:27:40,422
and I've been wandering
the streets ever since.

794
01:27:41,339 --> 01:27:43,842
I'm posing for artists these days,

795
01:27:44,009 --> 01:27:46,011
but it doesn't pay much.

796
01:27:47,512 --> 01:27:50,223
Oh, I only show my face and hands.

797
01:27:52,642 --> 01:27:55,187
They've promised to pay me tomorrow.

798
01:27:56,646 --> 01:27:59,357
Then I'll move back into my apartment.

799
01:28:08,033 --> 01:28:10,994
- Where are you two going?
- To get some cigars.

800
01:28:11,119 --> 01:28:12,454
In Havana.

801
01:28:12,579 --> 01:28:14,539
We'll be back tomorrow

802
01:28:14,706 --> 01:28:17,292
sure as arrows loosed by a steady hand.

803
01:28:30,889 --> 01:28:32,682
Where have you been?

804
01:28:32,808 --> 01:28:35,393
Don't ask any questions.

805
01:28:36,186 --> 01:28:39,022
Just let me sit here by your side.

806
01:28:39,648 --> 01:28:41,733
It's so warm here.

807
01:28:43,860 --> 01:28:46,988
I'll stay until tomorrow. All right?

808
01:28:47,489 --> 01:28:49,991
It's going to be very cold here.

809
01:28:50,450 --> 01:28:51,952
Good.

810
01:28:52,619 --> 01:28:55,455
It'll be just like before.

811
01:28:56,665 --> 01:28:58,750
I'll clear the table.

812
01:29:03,088 --> 01:29:05,257
The warmth has made me dizzy.

813
01:29:05,674 --> 01:29:07,759
I can hardly stand up.

814
01:29:14,432 --> 01:29:16,351
You have a fever.

815
01:29:16,977 --> 01:29:20,021
I'll help you into bed.

816
01:30:17,162 --> 01:30:20,749
Schaunard and I will go get a doctor.

817
01:30:21,499 --> 01:30:23,084
You stay here

818
01:30:23,209 --> 01:30:25,211
and keep Mimi company.

819
01:30:44,522 --> 01:30:46,858
I was awake the whole time.

820
01:30:47,943 --> 01:30:50,195
Rodolfo still loves me.

821
01:30:50,320 --> 01:30:52,072
What about you?

822
01:30:52,197 --> 01:30:54,658
I never stopped loving him.

823
01:30:54,783 --> 01:30:56,493
Then all is well.

824
01:30:58,453 --> 01:31:00,872
I'm going away forever.

825
01:31:01,998 --> 01:31:03,792
What are you talking about?

826
01:31:05,210 --> 01:31:07,379
I'm going to die soon.

827
01:31:08,129 --> 01:31:09,631
Look.

828
01:31:15,303 --> 01:31:17,305
You believe me now?

829
01:31:19,224 --> 01:31:21,893
If I'd stayed here

830
01:31:22,060 --> 01:31:23,895
with Rodolfo,

831
01:31:24,020 --> 01:31:26,356
everything would be fine now.

832
01:31:28,066 --> 01:31:29,818
Poor Rodolfo.

833
01:31:30,902 --> 01:31:33,863
He has to take care of me once again.

834
01:31:34,990 --> 01:31:37,075
But not for long.

835
01:31:39,119 --> 01:31:42,372
The last dress he buys me
will be white.

836
01:31:43,331 --> 01:31:45,917
Don't talk like that.
You'll get better.

837
01:31:46,418 --> 01:31:48,837
Rodolfo has gone for a doctor.

838
01:31:50,797 --> 01:31:53,758
It took me an hour
to climb the stairs yesterday.

839
01:31:54,342 --> 01:31:57,595
But if I'd found
another woman here with him,

840
01:31:57,762 --> 01:32:00,432
I'd have thrown myself
right out the window.

841
01:32:02,142 --> 01:32:04,185
Rodolfo knows everything.

842
01:32:43,099 --> 01:32:46,352
She must go to the hospital -
my hospital.

843
01:32:46,478 --> 01:32:48,480
I'll call an ambulance.

844
01:32:51,733 --> 01:32:53,568
I have a car.

845
01:33:34,317 --> 01:33:36,444
You must be brave.

846
01:33:37,862 --> 01:33:41,116
I can ease her pain,
but I can't save her.

847
01:33:42,867 --> 01:33:46,371
She'll live until spring at the latest.

848
01:33:48,373 --> 01:33:50,708
I can keep her in a private room,

849
01:33:50,875 --> 01:33:52,877
but I must warn you:

850
01:33:53,711 --> 01:33:57,382
Though it may seem cruel,
it's very expensive.

851
01:34:02,178 --> 01:34:04,180
I'll find the money.

852
01:34:25,410 --> 01:34:27,745
Who painted this? Becker?

853
01:36:08,012 --> 01:36:10,014
Open the curtains.

854
01:36:12,433 --> 01:36:15,812
Spring is here,
and I want to look outside.

855
01:36:35,290 --> 01:36:37,709
It's so grey in here.

856
01:36:41,170 --> 01:36:44,173
Why don't you pick me some flowers?

857
01:39:17,535 --> 01:39:19,412
She's dead.

858
01:39:21,998 --> 01:39:23,875
Shall we come with you?

859
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:25,877
That's all right.

860
01:39:26,335 --> 01:39:28,671
I need to be alone.
