Quit touching me.

对

534
00:47:09,400000 --> 00:47:12,906000
Mainly that there is something more than meaningfulness.
因为有些东西不仅是有意义

And purposefulness.

more in the land-him-in-the-shit genre.
是“给他好看”那种恶作剧

540
00:47:40,360000 --> 00:47:42,680000
A Corporation ls A Religion

What the fuck do you mean by that?

It's the pay-off. Child's Food.

547
00:48:05,095000 --> 00:48:07,597000
I'd fucking well figured that out.

548
00:48:07,597000 --> 00:48:11,868000
But the company does actually make children's foods.
但他们真的生产小孩的食品

549
00:48:11,868000 --> 00:48:14,938000
- I didn't know that. - You didn't know that?
我倒不晓得 你不晓得？

550
00:48:14,938000 --> 00:48:18,840000
You should have checked before coming up with such crap.
你应该先搞清楚再出主意 就这样丢一张纸过来

551
00:48:18,840000 --> 00:48:21,120000
A pathetic slip of paper.
我说话时你闭嘴

Shut up when I'm talking to you Saying CHILD'S FOOD.

你是对我有意见吗？ 不是

554
00:48:27,880000 --> 00:48:32,635000
They're using Hjort at the moment and they know it's hopeless.
他们现在的广告公司很逊

555
00:48:32,840000 --> 00:48:35,558000
But you've stoked Benedikte's fires nicely.

556

On the phone she sounds ready.

00:48:38,440000 --> 00:48:40,760000
She's crazy for you. For some reason.

558
00:48:40,760000 --> 00:48:45,000000
I've made some flashy folders with charts and all.
我准备了很多图表和资料

559
00:48:45,000000 --> 00:48:48,920000
They're for another product, and she won't look at them anyway.
是别的产品，她反正不会看

560
00:48:48,920000 --> 00:48:53,565000
But when you come up with crap like that
可是你却拿这种东西出来

561
00:48:54,640000 --> 00:49:02,680000
It's known as baby food, not child's food.
通常都说“婴儿食品” 什么？

562
00:49:02,680000 --> 00:49:05,274000
So "Child's Food" can easily be the pay-off -
不是“小孩食品”

563
00:49:05,357000 --> 00:49:08,320000
- for someone who makes baby food.
小孩食品能当婴儿食品的标语

564

Quite sophisticated, really.

565
00:49:13,880000 --> 00:49:19,402000
- Baby food, child's food. - Baby food, child's food.
婴儿食品，小孩食品 婴儿食品，小孩食品

566
00:49:20,240000 --> 00:49:21,920000
Bloody hell.

00:49:21,920000 --> 00:49:24,760000
She's here. I'll go and talk to her first.
她来了，我先和她谈

568
00:49:24,760000 --> 00:49:28,560000
Then you come in with Svendsen. And Severin, to be on the safe side.
史文森也会来

569
00:49:28,560000 --> 00:49:32,150000
But whatever she says today, keep your balls in the air.

571
00:49:34,085000 --> 00:49:38,044000

- No. - We haven't had much time.
不认识 时间有限，有时候就是这样

576
00:50:02,680000 --> 00:50:06,468000
But sometimes that's what it takes. A deadline
有期限…

577
00:50:06,680000 --> 00:50:10,982000
Axel, will you show us what you've got?
