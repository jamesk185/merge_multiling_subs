2
00:02:05,792000 --> 00:02:07,792000
Shit!
该死

3
00:02:13,802000 --> 00:02:15,844000
Did I hurt myself?
受伤了

4
00:02:15,802000 --> 00:02:18,722000
My God - blood!
出血了

5
00:02:52,842000 --> 00:02:55,092000
- Everything okay, Marcel? - No.
你还好吗

6
00:02:54,842000 --> 00:02:58,842000
What do you think, with the middle of my face smashed in?
我的脸刚才受伤了

7
00:03:03,852000 --> 00:03:06,228000
Red wine.
要红酒

8
00:03:41,892000 --> 00:03:46,143000
These glasses are smaller than a drunkard's dreams.
这不是干净的杯子

9
00:03:45,902000 --> 00:03:49,938000
- Any luck with the publisher? - No, the swine!
出版社怎么样

10
00:03:47,902000 --> 00:03:52,941000
He said it was too long and demanded cuts,
说我的戏曲太长了

11
00:03:50,902000 --> 00:03:56,486000
but with no promises and no advance - the lout!
也不给我定金  只是叫我写短一点 混蛋

12
00:03:55,912000 --> 00:03:59,573000
- Why not let me read it? - You?
能给我看看吗 你

13
00:03:58,912000 --> 00:04:00,866000
Yes, me.
是的

14
00:03:59,912000 --> 00:04:02,826000
You can read?
你识字吗

15
00:04:02,912000 --> 00:04:04,745000
Are you kidding?
可以看懂

16
00:04:03,912000 --> 00:04:07,789000
I finished third grade in Mongéo before coming to Paris.
我在小学的时候已经学过

17
00:04:07,312000 --> 00:04:10,125000
I'll read it at bedtime.
我想在入睡之前念

18
00:04:09,922000 --> 00:04:12,169000
Why not?
好吧我借给你

19
00:04:11,922000 --> 00:04:15,172000
You'll give me the people's appraisal
看完后告诉我你的感想

20
00:04:14,922000 --> 00:04:18,922000
and put the publishers to shame.
希望你能看出出版商  没能看出的东西

21
00:04:25,307000 --> 00:04:29,932000
<i>The Avenger - A Play in 21 Acts</i> by Marcel Marx
"复仇者"21幕剧

22
00:06:22,052000 --> 00:06:24,968000
EVICTION NOTICE
马上搬出去

23
00:06:49,082000 --> 00:06:53,082000
Good morning, Monsieur Marcel.
马歇尔先生  我们已经说好8日退房吧

24
00:06:51,453000 --> 00:06:57,082000
这么快就到时间了吗
Have you forgotten that today is the eighth? Already? How time rushes on!

26
00:06:58,092000 --> 00:07:00,754000
You're a bit slow in vacating the premises.
请搬出去

27
00:07:00,092000 --> 00:07:04,082000
It's already 11:30.
已经11点半了  下一位住户到了

28
00:07:02,923000 --> 00:07:07,102000
The new tenant may arrive at any moment.
请帮我叫一下出租车

29
00:07:05,175000 --> 00:07:09,102000
Allow me to find a moving van.
谢谢

30
00:07:07,510000 --> 00:07:13,099000
但之前还有点事情要做
By all means! But there's one little formality to see to first:

32
00:07:14,017000 --> 00:07:18,112000
your three months' back rent.
你还没有交3个月的房租

33
00:07:16,561000 --> 00:07:19,112000
Would you mind? - Of course not.
我会付清的

34
00:07:19,112000 --> 00:07:23,568000
Then kindly step into my office, so I may give you a receipt.
如果你到事务所  我会给你开单

35
00:07:23,112000 --> 00:07:26,122000
- When I return. - Why not now?
回来之后马上过去 现在马上

36
00:07:26,029000 --> 00:07:30,112000
I must go to the bank. I don't carry a sum like that on me.
不去银行就没有钱给你

37
00:07:33,122000 --> 00:07:36,456000
I see. No cash.
那就没办法了

38
00:07:36,132000 --> 00:07:40,122000
Then allow me to relieve you of that little burden
等你回来之前  我会替你保管这些东西

39
00:07:39,793000 --> 00:07:44,142000
so it doesn't tire you.
如果这里面  有贵重东西怎么办

40
00:07:42,128000 --> 00:07:46,142000
You think I'd carry off my belongings in a bag?
这是规矩

41
00:07:45,465000 --> 00:07:50,804000
付清房租之前  你别想拿走任何东西
Those are the rules. You're not to remove so much as a single hair until the rent is paid.

43
00:07:50,929000 --> 00:07:53,152000
There's no hair in here,
里面是我的衬衫

44
00:07:52,931000 --> 00:07:57,142000
just shirts I'm taking to the laundry
我想拿到银行隔壁的洗衣房

45
00:07:55,642000 --> 00:07:58,269000
next door to the bank, just steps from here.

46
00:07:58,152000 --> 00:08:00,397000
Please do not misunderstand me,
你把我当成傻瓜吗

47
00:08:00,152000 --> 00:08:04,152000
but certain unfortunate experiences
租房子的人不可信  这是我长年的经验

48
00:08:02,857000 --> 00:08:05,652000
have shattered my faith in tenants.

49
00:08:06,162000 --> 00:08:10,152000
Hugo had best accompany you to the bank.
尤高会跟你一起去银行

50
00:08:18,498000 --> 00:08:20,041000
See this man?

51
00:08:20,166000 --> 00:08:22,335000
He's been casing this bank for three days.

52
00:08:22,460000 --> 00:08:23,753000
I live across the street.

53
00:08:23,878000 --> 00:08:26,214000
His accomplice is around the corner in an Alfa Romeo,

54
00:08:26,339000 --> 00:08:28,591000
reading <i>Le Monde -</i> upside down.

55
00:08:28,717000 --> 00:08:30,760000
I only wish to do my duty.

56
00:08:30,927000 --> 00:08:32,971000
My life's savings are in this bank.

57
00:08:33,096000 --> 00:08:35,432000
What do you suppose is in his bag?

58
00:08:58,788000 --> 00:09:01,374000
Has my apartment been vacated?

59
00:09:01,499000 --> 00:09:04,419000
Not yet, Monsieur Schaunard, but very soon.

60
00:09:04,544000 --> 00:09:08,631000
The previous tenant, a writer, has gone to get a moving van.

61
00:09:08,798000 --> 00:09:12,761000
In the meantime, you may leave your furniture outside.

62
00:09:12,886000 --> 00:09:16,014000
I'm afraid. If it rains, my furniture will be damaged.

63
00:09:22,437000 --> 00:09:25,273000
You will forgive me if I ask your profession.

64
00:09:25,398000 --> 00:09:28,735000
You neglected to indicate that on the lease.

65
00:09:31,654000 --> 00:09:35,950000
Leave the piano here and return at once to my old lodgings

66
00:09:36,076000 --> 00:09:39,162000
for the rest of my priceless furnishings

67
00:09:39,287000 --> 00:09:41,539000
and works of art.

68
00:09:51,174000 --> 00:09:55,845000
Henri, from the Ministry of War. It just arrived by courier.

69
00:09:56,012000 --> 00:09:58,181000
The Ministry of War.

70
00:10:01,309000 --> 00:10:03,353000
It must be the pension

71
00:10:03,478000 --> 00:10:05,730000
that I've been waiting for all these years.

72
00:10:05,855000 --> 00:10:08,858000
At last some recognition of my achievements.

73
00:10:09,609000 --> 00:10:13,738000
<i>Dear Monsieur Bernard, courtesy demands that I inform you</i>

74
00:10:13,863000 --> 00:10:16,282000
<i>of the unfortunate predicament I find myself in</i>

75
00:10:16,407000 --> 00:10:19,369000
<i>that prevents me at this time from observing the custom</i>

76
00:10:19,536000 --> 00:10:23,206000
<i>requiring that rent be paid, especially when it's due.</i>

77
00:10:23,331000 --> 00:10:25,333000
<i>Until this morning I had hoped</i>

78
00:10:25,458000 --> 00:10:29,045000
<i>to honor this lo very day by paying my rent</i> - <i>ah, delusion!</i>

79
00:10:29,170000 --> 00:10:32,757000
<i>As I slept cradled in false certainty, misfortune -</i>

80
00:10:32,882000 --> 00:10:35,802000
Ananke <i>in Greek - dashed my hopes.</i>

81
00:10:35,927000 --> 00:10:38,930000
<i>Certain sizable sums I expected did not materialize,</i>

82
00:10:39,055000 --> 00:10:43,184000
<i>but our beautiful France and I will see better days - have no doubt of that.</i>

83
00:10:43,309000 --> 00:10:47,355000
<i>The moment we do, I shall hasten to inform you of it</i>

84
00:10:47,480000 --> 00:10:51,359000
<i>and to remove from my lodgings my precious possessions,</i>

85
00:10:51,484000 --> 00:10:55,029000
<i>which I leave to your safekeeping and to that of the law,</i>

86
00:10:55,155000 --> 00:10:58,825000
<i>which restrains you from selling them for one year.</i>

87
00:10:58,950000 --> 00:11:01,995000
<i>Until then you are at liberty to use</i>

88
00:11:02,120000 --> 00:11:04,539000
<i>the luxurious lodgings in which I have resided.</i>

89
00:11:04,664000 --> 00:11:08,209000
<i>In affirmation of my consent, I hereby affix my signature.</i>

90
00:11:08,334000 --> 00:11:10,712000
<i>Marcel Marx.</i>

91
00:11:39,782000 --> 00:11:42,869000
- Two half orders of trout. - Yes, sir.

92
00:11:48,666000 --> 00:11:50,877000
That's a strange order.

93
00:11:51,127000 --> 00:11:52,629000
On the contrary.

94
00:11:52,754000 --> 00:11:55,340000
This method yields on average

95
00:11:55,465000 --> 00:11:58,468000
a quarter more than ordering a full portion.

96
00:12:10,688000 --> 00:12:12,357000
Where is my order?

97
00:12:12,482000 --> 00:12:16,069000
I'm afraid this gentleman got the last trout.

98
00:12:21,199000 --> 00:12:24,494000
May I invite you to partake of this course with me?

99
00:12:24,661000 --> 00:12:27,664000
I would not deprive you of what is yours, sir.

100
00:12:27,830000 --> 00:12:32,168000
Then you'd deprive me of the pleasure of expressing my goodwill?

101
00:12:32,293000 --> 00:12:35,296000
In that case, sir...

102
00:12:42,345000 --> 00:12:45,139000
Permit me to refrain from serving you the head.

103
00:12:45,265000 --> 00:12:47,600000
That I couldn't allow.

104
00:12:47,725000 --> 00:12:51,354000
For if the head is man's noblest appendage,

105
00:12:51,479000 --> 00:12:55,108000
it's the most unpleasant part of a trout.

106
00:12:57,026000 --> 00:13:00,280000
Two heads! This trout is bicephalic,

107
00:13:00,405000 --> 00:13:03,032000
a word which comes from the Greek

108
00:13:03,199000 --> 00:13:04,951000
and means...

109
00:13:05,076000 --> 00:13:07,120000
precisely that.

110
00:13:08,538000 --> 00:13:12,375000
Nevertheless, I harbor no regrets about eating this phenomenon.

111
00:13:21,384000 --> 00:13:23,386000
The sauce was delicious.

112
00:13:23,511000 --> 00:13:25,054000
True.

113
00:13:25,388000 --> 00:13:28,099000
It was prepared in the province of Béarn,

114
00:13:28,224000 --> 00:13:31,311000
and its fine reputation is richly deserved.

115
00:13:31,436000 --> 00:13:34,355000
You seem very learned. You're not from here?

116
00:13:34,480000 --> 00:13:35,648000
No.

117
00:13:35,773000 --> 00:13:37,734000
I come from Albania

118
00:13:38,401000 --> 00:13:41,195000
and have lived in Paris only three years now.

119
00:13:41,321000 --> 00:13:44,198000
Yet you've already mastered our language.

120
00:13:44,324000 --> 00:13:47,785000
My nursemaid was French, from Barcelona.

121
00:13:48,745000 --> 00:13:50,747000
My name is Rodolfo,

122
00:13:50,913000 --> 00:13:52,707000
and I'm a painter.

123
00:13:52,832000 --> 00:13:54,959000
Marcel Marx, writer.

124
00:13:55,084000 --> 00:13:57,420000
May I offer you a bottle of wine?

125
00:13:57,545000 --> 00:13:59,797000
Only on one condition:

126
00:13:59,922000 --> 00:14:03,384000
that I see to the coffee and the rest.

127
00:14:04,510000 --> 00:14:07,263000
As a painter, don't you think

128
00:14:07,388000 --> 00:14:09,766000
that Malevich's <i>Black</i> Square

129
00:14:09,932000 --> 00:14:12,185000
is as lethal a blow to painting

130
00:14:12,310000 --> 00:14:14,062000
as the school of Vienna -

131
00:14:14,187000 --> 00:14:17,482000
Schoenberg, Berg, Webern, and the rest - is to music?

132
00:14:17,607000 --> 00:14:20,276000
- I agree entirely. - Let's go.

133
00:14:32,455000 --> 00:14:34,582000
I live just around the corner.

134
00:14:34,707000 --> 00:14:36,793000
We may continue our discussion there.

135
00:14:40,797000 --> 00:14:43,049000
“I floated down impassive rivers,

136
00:14:43,174000 --> 00:14:45,551000
unguided now by bargemen's hands.

137
00:14:45,676000 --> 00:14:48,179000
Howling natives had hauled them up for targets

138
00:14:48,304000 --> 00:14:50,807000
and nailed them naked to painted stakes.”

139
00:14:50,973000 --> 00:14:52,975000
Beautiful stuff, Rimbaud.

140
00:14:53,976000 --> 00:14:58,314000
He and Verlaine argued vehemently about -

141
00:14:58,481000 --> 00:15:01,401000
Anyway, come inside.

142
00:15:02,819000 --> 00:15:05,113000
This is where I live.

143
00:15:12,537000 --> 00:15:14,831000
Strange. The key's in the lock,

144
00:15:14,997000 --> 00:15:17,708000
though I put it in my pocket this morning -

145
00:15:21,212000 --> 00:15:23,297000
where it remains even now.

146
00:15:24,465000 --> 00:15:27,218000
It's witchcraft! Two keys.

147
00:15:29,846000 --> 00:15:33,516000
Someone's playing the violin. These aren't my lodgings.

148
00:15:54,954000 --> 00:15:57,206000
May I help you?

149
00:15:57,331000 --> 00:16:00,668000
I was mistaken. This isn't my apartment.

150
00:16:01,335000 --> 00:16:03,963000
I beg your pardon on my friend's behalf.

151
00:16:04,088000 --> 00:16:06,048000
He's exceptionally drunk.

152
00:16:06,215000 --> 00:16:07,717000
Wait, this is my place.

153
00:16:07,925000 --> 00:16:10,845000
That's my finery!

154
00:16:14,015000 --> 00:16:15,725000
And what's this?

155
00:16:15,892000 --> 00:16:17,602000
My Turkish slippers,

156
00:16:17,727000 --> 00:16:20,271000
given to me by beloved hands!

157
00:16:24,108000 --> 00:16:28,404000
“Marcel Marx is hereby obligated to vacate the premises

158
00:16:28,571000 --> 00:16:30,865000
by noon on February eighth...”

159
00:16:30,990000 --> 00:16:33,868000
Am I not the Marcel Marx

160
00:16:33,993000 --> 00:16:36,454000
whom the landlord evicted?

161
00:16:37,580000 --> 00:16:39,999000
The situation is as follows.

162
00:16:40,166000 --> 00:16:41,667000
By law

163
00:16:41,792000 --> 00:16:43,669000
the premises are mine,

164
00:16:43,794000 --> 00:16:47,840000
for you were evicted, and I paid in advance.

165
00:16:47,965000 --> 00:16:51,177000
Yes, for the premises, but not the furnishings.

166
00:16:51,302000 --> 00:16:53,262000
If I pay up, I may remove them legally -

167
00:16:53,429000 --> 00:16:56,057000
or even illegally, if it were possible.

168
00:16:56,182000 --> 00:17:00,019000
Thus you have furnishings but no lodgings,

169
00:17:00,144000 --> 00:17:03,648000
and I have lodgings but no furniture. - Precisely.

170
00:17:03,773000 --> 00:17:05,399000
I like the apartment.

171
00:17:05,525000 --> 00:17:08,569000
And I've never liked it more. - Pardon?

172
00:17:08,694000 --> 00:17:11,322000
Never as much as now, and I know what I'm saying.

173
00:17:11,447000 --> 00:17:14,408000
What do you say we lubricate this explanation?

174
00:17:25,962000 --> 00:17:28,130000
What an amazing pipe you have.

175
00:17:28,339000 --> 00:17:32,677000
I have an even more handsome one for use in high society.

176
00:17:32,802000 --> 00:17:35,221000
Would you care to try it? - With pleasure.

177
00:17:36,472000 --> 00:17:39,725000
You appear to be a man of musical bent.

178
00:17:40,101000 --> 00:17:41,769000
A composer.

179
00:17:41,894000 --> 00:17:44,814000
I'm writing a piece called

180
00:17:44,939000 --> 00:17:49,443000
“The Influence of Blue on the Arts.”

181
00:20:31,522000 --> 00:20:34,984000
- I can't see anyone just now. - Why not?

182
00:20:35,317000 --> 00:20:36,986000
Good morning.

183
00:20:38,362000 --> 00:20:40,114000
Good morning, mademoiselle.

184
00:20:40,239000 --> 00:20:43,033000
- There's my answer. - I understand.

185
00:20:44,160000 --> 00:20:47,580000
All the same, perhaps you might lend me 1,000 francs.

186
00:20:47,705000 --> 00:20:49,832000
I'm all out of paint,

187
00:20:49,999000 --> 00:20:53,335000
and I can't complete my masterpiece.

188
00:20:53,502000 --> 00:20:56,589000
You're asking a lot. I'm broke at the moment.

189
00:20:56,714000 --> 00:20:59,258000
Couldn't you borrow it from the girl?

190
00:20:59,383000 --> 00:21:03,137000
I couldn't do that. We just met yesterday.

191
00:21:03,262000 --> 00:21:06,098000
- And Schaunard? - No one's seen him all week.

192
00:21:06,223000 --> 00:21:07,683000
Good-bye.

193
00:21:15,858000 --> 00:21:17,526000
Where are you going?

194
00:21:17,735000 --> 00:21:19,361000
To your place...

195
00:21:19,528000 --> 00:21:21,864000
to collect what you owe me.

196
00:21:22,698000 --> 00:21:24,867000
You won't find me at home.

197
00:21:25,701000 --> 00:21:29,371000
I can't pay you back today. I'm waiting for a girl.

198
00:21:31,665000 --> 00:21:34,627000
But you can pawn my ring.

199
00:21:37,129000 --> 00:21:38,798000
There she is.

200
00:21:39,131000 --> 00:21:40,800000
Beat it.

201
00:21:55,815000 --> 00:21:57,942000
What if she comes back to you?

202
00:21:58,234000 --> 00:22:00,569000
You'd no longer have the ring.

203
00:22:01,320000 --> 00:22:03,656000
She won't come back.

204
00:22:03,781000 --> 00:22:06,492000
She ran off with an American.

205
00:22:07,326000 --> 00:22:09,328000
He had a Cadillac.

206
00:22:09,453000 --> 00:22:11,455000
It's a shame about the children.

207
00:22:11,580000 --> 00:22:13,582000
She left them with me,

208
00:22:13,749000 --> 00:22:17,044000
and I don't have enough to feed them.

209
00:22:17,169000 --> 00:22:20,631000
They cry out from hunger in the night.

210
00:22:20,756000 --> 00:22:22,383000
How old are they?

211
00:22:22,508000 --> 00:22:23,592000
Fourteen...

212
00:22:23,717000 --> 00:22:24,969000
nine...

213
00:22:25,094000 --> 00:22:27,179000
seven... six...

214
00:22:27,304000 --> 00:22:28,222000
three... two...

215
00:22:28,347000 --> 00:22:29,431000
one...

216
00:22:29,557000 --> 00:22:31,433000
and the youngest is just six months.

217
00:22:31,600000 --> 00:22:33,477000
So many!

218
00:22:33,644000 --> 00:22:36,438000
We were young and in love.

219
00:22:37,398000 --> 00:22:39,275000
It was spring.

220
00:24:11,700000 --> 00:24:13,786000
You look strange.

221
00:24:13,994000 --> 00:24:15,913000
What's the matter?

222
00:24:16,872000 --> 00:24:19,541000
I think I have fallen in love.

223
00:24:20,250000 --> 00:24:22,044000
With whom?

224
00:24:22,252000 --> 00:24:24,088000
I don't know...

225
00:24:24,213000 --> 00:24:26,507000
but she's sitting over there.

226
00:24:27,549000 --> 00:24:29,718000
She's not bad-looking.

227
00:24:30,594000 --> 00:24:32,763000
Why don't you do something?

228
00:24:34,723000 --> 00:24:37,059000
What if she rejects me?

229
00:24:37,726000 --> 00:24:40,062000
I'd never get over it.

230
00:24:42,606000 --> 00:24:45,109000
It's our custom in Albania to first -

231
00:24:45,234000 --> 00:24:46,944000
You stay here.

232
00:24:47,987000 --> 00:24:51,699000
I'll go speak to her on your behalf.

233
00:24:52,908000 --> 00:24:56,787000
I will awaken in her heart a passion...

234
00:24:57,413000 --> 00:24:59,164000
for you.

235
00:24:59,415000 --> 00:25:01,625000
I will lie

236
00:25:01,750000 --> 00:25:03,752000
shamelessly.

237
00:25:10,092000 --> 00:25:11,677000
Good evening.

238
00:25:12,219000 --> 00:25:14,346000
See that man over there?

239
00:25:14,471000 --> 00:25:17,433000
He is in love with you.

240
00:25:22,521000 --> 00:25:24,606000
But so am I.

241
00:25:57,014000 --> 00:26:00,059000
Excuse me. Can I help you?

242
00:26:00,184000 --> 00:26:01,852000
I fell asleep.

243
00:26:01,977000 --> 00:26:03,103000
Where are you going?

244
00:26:03,228000 --> 00:26:04,480000
Nowhere.

245
00:26:04,605000 --> 00:26:07,775000
I arrived in town, but my girlfriend isn't in.

246
00:26:07,900000 --> 00:26:09,777000
I was to stay with her.

247
00:26:09,902000 --> 00:26:11,945000
It's no use waiting.

248
00:26:12,071000 --> 00:26:15,199000
She was taken to prison, for three years.

249
00:26:22,498000 --> 00:26:24,500000
What am I going to do now?

250
00:26:24,625000 --> 00:26:28,629000
I arrived today from Rouen. I don't know anyone here.

251
00:26:29,588000 --> 00:26:31,173000
If you like...

252
00:26:31,340000 --> 00:26:33,884000
I live next door.

253
00:26:34,802000 --> 00:26:38,013000
Tell me: Are you a proper French gentleman?

254
00:26:38,180000 --> 00:26:39,306000
No.

255
00:26:39,431000 --> 00:26:41,600000
I mean, yes...

256
00:26:41,725000 --> 00:26:43,685000
but I'm not French.

257
00:26:43,811000 --> 00:26:45,479000
I'm Albanian.

258
00:26:46,105000 --> 00:26:47,981000
That Will do.

259
00:27:22,432000 --> 00:27:25,227000
I'm going now and taking the dog with me.

260
00:27:25,352000 --> 00:27:28,689000
He sometimes makes noise at night due to nightmares.

261
00:27:28,814000 --> 00:27:30,440000
But why?

262
00:27:30,649000 --> 00:27:32,985000
I can sleep on the sofa.

263
00:27:33,193000 --> 00:27:35,195000
It's too hard for a bed.

264
00:27:35,320000 --> 00:27:36,738000
And besides...

265
00:27:36,864000 --> 00:27:38,907000
I'm hot-blooded,

266
00:27:39,199000 --> 00:27:41,243000
and you are very beautiful.

267
00:27:41,743000 --> 00:27:44,454000
- Where will you go? - To a friend's.

268
00:27:44,580000 --> 00:27:46,582000
He lives close by.

269
00:27:48,625000 --> 00:27:50,335000
Sleep peacefully.

270
00:27:50,586000 --> 00:27:53,046000
I'll be back in the morning.

271
00:28:38,175000 --> 00:28:39,676000
Baudelaire.

272
00:29:21,510000 --> 00:29:26,014000
“I have gone to seek lodgings. Thank you for your kindness. Mimi.”

273
00:30:24,990000 --> 00:30:26,908000
Where's your black coat?

274
00:30:27,034000 --> 00:30:28,744000
Can't you see?

275
00:30:30,871000 --> 00:30:32,789000
You've ruined it.

276
00:30:33,040000 --> 00:30:34,958000
I'm lost.

277
00:30:37,127000 --> 00:30:39,546000
I've been summoned by Gassot, the newspaper czar.

278
00:30:39,671000 --> 00:30:42,507000
He's founding a fashion magazine, <i>The Sash of Iris,</i>

279
00:30:42,632000 --> 00:30:44,760000
and plans to make me editor in chief.

280
00:30:44,926000 --> 00:30:48,055000
If I show up in this getup, he may change his mind.

281
00:30:48,180000 --> 00:30:50,932000
You can't accept his offer anyway.

282
00:30:51,099000 --> 00:30:54,603000
Gassot is a supporter of the right.

283
00:30:54,936000 --> 00:30:57,522000
Your principles won't allow you to eat bread

284
00:30:57,647000 --> 00:30:59,941000
bathed in the sweat of the people. - You're mistaken.

285
00:31:00,108000 --> 00:31:02,736000
He's in the left flank of the right wing in Parliament.

286
00:31:02,861000 --> 00:31:05,155000
Just yesterday he voted for widows' pensions.

287
00:31:05,280000 --> 00:31:09,159000
Besides, he knows influential people whom I'll convince to commission

288
00:31:09,284000 --> 00:31:12,579000
compositions from you and portraits from Rodolfo.

289
00:31:12,704000 --> 00:31:14,456000
That changes everything.

290
00:31:14,623000 --> 00:31:16,958000
What time's your meeting?

291
00:31:18,627000 --> 00:31:20,796000
At 5100.

292
00:31:22,714000 --> 00:31:25,717000
There's no time to lose.

293
00:31:27,135000 --> 00:31:29,429000
I can polish my shoes black

294
00:31:29,554000 --> 00:31:31,848000
so no one will notice

295
00:31:31,973000 --> 00:31:34,935000
that one is round-toed and the other pointed.

296
00:31:36,603000 --> 00:31:39,189000
I need a black coat!

297
00:31:39,481000 --> 00:31:43,735000
I'd give ten years of my life and my right hand for one.

298
00:31:43,944000 --> 00:31:46,988000
- Is Rodolfo the painter in? - That's me.

299
00:31:47,155000 --> 00:31:49,908000
My cousin recommends your reasonably priced portraits.

300
00:31:50,033000 --> 00:31:52,494000
I'm told they're very good likenesses.

301
00:31:53,787000 --> 00:31:55,705000
More accurate than photographs.

302
00:31:55,831000 --> 00:31:57,582000
He's very talented.

303
00:31:57,707000 --> 00:31:59,709000
He won every award at school.

304
00:31:59,835000 --> 00:32:02,796000
My son won an award, and he's only seven.

305
00:32:02,921000 --> 00:32:04,297000
A talented child.

306
00:32:04,423000 --> 00:32:06,425000
This portrait you want, Monsieur...

307
00:32:06,550000 --> 00:32:09,553000
Blancheron, from Nantes. I'm a sugar producer.

308
00:32:09,678000 --> 00:32:12,556000
I've even written books on the subject.

309
00:32:12,681000 --> 00:32:16,518000
I'd like a medium-sized portrait.

310
00:32:16,643000 --> 00:32:19,104000
Like that one. Who is that of?

311
00:32:19,229000 --> 00:32:20,939000
My mother.

312
00:32:21,064000 --> 00:32:23,233000
How much would one of that size cost?

313
00:32:23,358000 --> 00:32:25,527000
Between 1,000 and 1,200 francs,

314
00:32:25,652000 --> 00:32:28,029000
depending on whether your hands show.

315
00:32:28,196000 --> 00:32:31,074000
- My cousin said 500. - It depends on the season.

316
00:32:31,199000 --> 00:32:33,910000
Paint prices vary with the season.

317
00:32:34,035000 --> 00:32:37,330000
- Interesting. Just like sugar. - Precisely.

318
00:32:37,456000 --> 00:32:40,542000
- Paint me one for 1,000 francs. - You're making a mistake.

319
00:32:40,667000 --> 00:32:44,713000
For 200 more, he'll paint your hands holding your book on sugar.

320
00:32:44,838000 --> 00:32:48,341000
You simply must do it. - Would that look good?

321
00:32:48,467000 --> 00:32:50,260000
Exceptionally good.

322
00:32:50,385000 --> 00:32:52,721000
Is the portrait for your home?

323
00:32:52,846000 --> 00:32:54,431000
Yes, the living room.

324
00:32:54,556000 --> 00:32:57,476000
Then you must be in a dressing gown.

325
00:32:59,269000 --> 00:33:01,313000
Please sit in this chair.

326
00:33:03,273000 --> 00:33:05,275000
Take off your coat.

327
00:33:09,029000 --> 00:33:11,072000
I don't have a dressing gown with me.

328
00:33:11,198000 --> 00:33:12,657000
Don't worry.

329
00:33:12,782000 --> 00:33:15,202000
My friend will lend you his.

330
00:33:24,503000 --> 00:33:28,548000
Marcel, please hang up the gentleman's coat.

331
00:33:29,716000 --> 00:33:32,886000
How unfortunate. I'll be late for supper.

332
00:33:33,011000 --> 00:33:36,973000
The restaurant downstairs will send up anything we want.

333
00:33:37,641000 --> 00:33:40,060000
I'll go order something.

334
00:33:53,949000 --> 00:33:58,620000
I have several ideas to improve the contents of your magazine.

335
00:33:58,787000 --> 00:34:02,999000
For instance, one could - this is just one possibility -

336
00:34:03,124000 --> 00:34:05,252000
one could publish a play,

337
00:34:05,377000 --> 00:34:08,797000
and on the facing pages show the characters

338
00:34:08,964000 --> 00:34:12,634000
dressed in a certain way as if it were the fashion -

339
00:34:12,801000 --> 00:34:14,636000
the latest fashion, of course.

340
00:34:14,761000 --> 00:34:16,846000
One could also envision

341
00:34:16,972000 --> 00:34:19,766000
other things, like, for example,

342
00:34:19,891000 --> 00:34:23,687000
publishing the works of Baudelaire

343
00:34:23,812000 --> 00:34:25,855000
in serial form -

344
00:34:39,536000 --> 00:34:41,496000
<i>When may I come for it?</i>

345
00:34:41,663000 --> 00:34:45,041000
I'll finish it tomorrow and bring it to you.

346
00:34:46,126000 --> 00:34:50,171000
I'd prefer to pay at once so as not to remain in debt to you.

347
00:34:50,797000 --> 00:34:53,383000
We're alike in that respect.

348
00:34:53,508000 --> 00:34:56,678000
My cash is at the hotel. You'll have it tomorrow.

349
00:34:56,845000 --> 00:34:59,764000
Now, if you'd get me my coat...

350
00:35:11,860000 --> 00:35:14,279000
It was very dusty, so I had it laundered.

351
00:35:14,404000 --> 00:35:16,781000
They only charged 40 francs.

352
00:35:16,906000 --> 00:35:19,242000
Just add it to my bill.

353
00:35:42,641000 --> 00:35:44,851000
I'm not paying a thing!

354
00:35:51,066000 --> 00:35:52,651000
Shit!

355
00:35:58,490000 --> 00:35:59,699000
The swine!

356
00:35:59,824000 --> 00:36:02,535000
He wanted to charge me

357
00:36:02,744000 --> 00:36:04,704000
for a few miles.

358
00:36:11,503000 --> 00:36:13,755000
There must be 60,000 francs there.

359
00:36:13,922000 --> 00:36:16,341000
15,240, to be precise -

360
00:36:16,466000 --> 00:36:20,845000
an advance for producing a sample issue of The Sash of Iris.

361
00:36:21,596000 --> 00:36:23,264000
Here's my plan.

362
00:36:23,431000 --> 00:36:25,642000
Secure from life's material woes,

363
00:36:25,767000 --> 00:36:28,061000
I intend to go about this seriously.

364
00:36:28,186000 --> 00:36:31,272000
First I'll get rid of these rags and dress decently

365
00:36:31,439000 --> 00:36:34,109000
so that the fashion salons will take me seriously.

366
00:36:34,275000 --> 00:36:36,194000
If you'll follow my example,

367
00:36:36,319000 --> 00:36:39,406000
I can hire you as door-to-door ad salesmen.

368
00:36:39,531000 --> 00:36:43,451000
Until then, let a strict economy govern our lives.

369
00:36:44,160000 --> 00:36:46,246000
I accept wholeheartedly.

370
00:36:46,371000 --> 00:36:48,164000
But to start with,

371
00:36:48,289000 --> 00:36:51,126000
give me a couple of thousand francs.

372
00:36:51,251000 --> 00:36:52,293000
Why?

373
00:36:52,460000 --> 00:36:56,965000
As a door-to-door salesman, I must have a car

374
00:36:58,007000 --> 00:37:02,637000
to call on potential advertisers in the provinces.

375
00:37:03,304000 --> 00:37:04,848000
That's true.

376
00:37:05,765000 --> 00:37:07,851000
Shall we order a table?

377
00:37:07,976000 --> 00:37:11,396000
Yes. Then I can tell you more about my new job.

378
00:37:12,564000 --> 00:37:16,443000
There's an excellent restaurant not far from here.

379
00:37:16,568000 --> 00:37:18,528000
It's a bit expensive,

380
00:37:18,653000 --> 00:37:22,615000
but we'll make it up in the time we save.

381
00:37:23,074000 --> 00:37:25,410000
Very well, but starting tomorrow

382
00:37:25,535000 --> 00:37:28,663000
we shall devise even greater means of economizing.

383
00:37:28,830000 --> 00:37:33,168000
No more eating out. We'll hire a woman to cook for us.

384
00:37:33,960000 --> 00:37:36,296000
It would be wiser to take on a manservant

385
00:37:36,421000 --> 00:37:38,631000
who could then double as cook.

386
00:37:38,757000 --> 00:37:41,509000
Our household would be in impeccable order

387
00:37:41,676000 --> 00:37:44,012000
and we'd have much more time to work

388
00:37:44,137000 --> 00:37:48,683000
with him to shine our shoes and see to our errands.

389
00:37:48,808000 --> 00:37:51,895000
Then we'll need larger accommodations.

390
00:37:52,020000 --> 00:37:54,606000
That, in any case, is unavoidable

391
00:37:54,731000 --> 00:37:59,527000
if we mean to live in keeping with our new position in society.

392
00:38:05,575000 --> 00:38:07,410000
I'll be back.

393
00:38:18,588000 --> 00:38:21,090000
A pack of Celtiques, please.

394
00:38:24,636000 --> 00:38:26,262000
Good evening, Mimi.

395
00:38:26,387000 --> 00:38:28,389000
You found work.

396
00:38:29,098000 --> 00:38:30,975000
As you can see.

397
00:38:31,226000 --> 00:38:34,896000
- And a place to live? - It comes with the job.

398
00:38:35,230000 --> 00:38:37,690000
Are you going to the nightclub?

399
00:38:39,234000 --> 00:38:41,486000
I just came along with my friends.

400
00:38:41,611000 --> 00:38:43,571000
I don't care for modern music.

401
00:38:43,738000 --> 00:38:46,032000
I'm going to have a drink.

402
00:38:49,911000 --> 00:38:51,913000
A glass of water, please.

403
00:39:12,433000 --> 00:39:15,270000
<i>- Who was that? - A regular.</i>

404
00:39:15,395000 --> 00:39:17,730000
He has the manners of a peasant.

405
00:39:37,125000 --> 00:39:39,586000
It's kind of you to see me home,

406
00:39:39,711000 --> 00:39:42,255000
but this is nowhere near where I live.

407
00:39:45,675000 --> 00:39:47,844000
I wish you lived in Moscow

408
00:39:47,969000 --> 00:39:51,764000
so I might have your company that much longer.

409
00:39:52,682000 --> 00:39:54,642000
That's a bit too far.

410
00:39:56,311000 --> 00:39:58,771000
We could take the boulevard.

411
00:40:01,566000 --> 00:40:03,276000
Fancy that.

412
00:40:04,235000 --> 00:40:07,989000
We've arrived by chance where I live.

413
00:40:09,157000 --> 00:40:12,911000
Wouldn't you like to come up and say hello to the dog?

414
00:40:13,995000 --> 00:40:16,789000
Very well, but just for a moment.

415
00:40:16,915000 --> 00:40:18,958000
I'll make some coffee.

416
00:40:19,167000 --> 00:40:20,919000
In the meanwhile,

417
00:40:21,044000 --> 00:40:23,671000
you may enjoy the city view from my window.

418
00:40:30,511000 --> 00:40:32,055000
They wilted.

419
00:40:32,180000 --> 00:40:35,099000
Had I known, I'd have bought

420
00:40:35,224000 --> 00:40:37,018000
plastic flowers.

421
00:40:42,815000 --> 00:40:44,651000
What's his name?

422
00:40:44,776000 --> 00:40:46,277000
Baudelaire.

423
00:40:50,990000 --> 00:40:53,201000
I'm out of coffee,

424
00:40:53,368000 --> 00:40:55,411000
but I'll make some soup.

425
00:41:54,595000 --> 00:41:56,764000
May I kiss your hand?

426
00:42:01,102000 --> 00:42:02,937000
You move fast.

427
00:42:03,271000 --> 00:42:06,441000
The sooner to reach the goal.

428
00:42:49,358000 --> 00:42:51,360000
How much is this?

429
00:42:51,486000 --> 00:42:53,529000
A hundred francs.

430
00:42:55,031000 --> 00:42:56,532000
Fifty.

431
00:42:57,784000 --> 00:43:00,161000
All right. For you, 50.

432
00:43:06,334000 --> 00:43:08,169000
How about this?

433
00:44:30,459000 --> 00:44:32,670000
I live with two other girls.

434
00:44:33,421000 --> 00:44:35,423000
They have a male friend in common

435
00:44:35,590000 --> 00:44:38,509000
whom they're constantly fighting over.

436
00:44:38,634000 --> 00:44:40,428000
I don't get it.

437
00:44:40,636000 --> 00:44:42,263000
The man is stupid

438
00:44:42,388000 --> 00:44:45,266000
and ugly, and married to boot.

439
00:44:45,433000 --> 00:44:47,101000
Uglier than me?

440
00:44:47,226000 --> 00:44:48,936000
There's no comparison.

441
00:44:49,061000 --> 00:44:51,564000
Next to him, you're Lino Ventura.

442
00:44:51,689000 --> 00:44:53,274000
Who's that?

443
00:44:53,399000 --> 00:44:56,485000
An Italian movie star. You don't know him?

444
00:44:56,944000 --> 00:44:58,487000
Forget him.

445
00:44:58,613000 --> 00:45:00,448000
Let's talk about me.

446
00:45:00,615000 --> 00:45:02,992000
Why not...

447
00:45:03,409000 --> 00:45:05,369000
move in with me?

448
00:45:06,287000 --> 00:45:08,998000
I'm against marriage in principle,

449
00:45:09,999000 --> 00:45:13,127000
but we could make an exception.

450
00:45:13,294000 --> 00:45:15,463000
You'll stop working.

451
00:45:15,588000 --> 00:45:18,424000
I'll support us both with my paintings.

452
00:45:18,799000 --> 00:45:21,302000
And what would I do?

453
00:45:22,345000 --> 00:45:26,182000
You'd walk Baudelaire, clean the place -

454
00:45:26,307000 --> 00:45:27,975000
that sort of thing.

455
00:45:28,142000 --> 00:45:29,852000
Are you serious?

456
00:45:30,937000 --> 00:45:32,897000
I'll clean...

457
00:45:33,022000 --> 00:45:36,943000
and you can look out the window at the park.

458
00:45:37,068000 --> 00:45:39,654000
In the evenings we'll go to the opera.

459
00:45:58,839000 --> 00:46:01,008000
My wallet's been stolen.

460
00:46:02,343000 --> 00:46:04,345000
Do you have any money?

461
00:46:04,762000 --> 00:46:06,430000
Just a few francs.

462
00:46:31,122000 --> 00:46:32,581000
Police?

463
00:46:39,630000 --> 00:46:41,507000
Your passport.

464
00:46:56,981000 --> 00:46:59,734000
Listen, how much is their check?

465
00:46:59,900000 --> 00:47:01,569000
Four hundred twenty.

466
00:47:02,361000 --> 00:47:04,822000
Will you allow me to pay it?

467
00:47:05,740000 --> 00:47:09,076000
You think you'll get your money back from that burn?

468
00:47:09,201000 --> 00:47:11,203000
It doesn't matter.

469
00:47:11,454000 --> 00:47:14,790000
Then as far as we're concerned, the matter is settled.

470
00:47:20,421000 --> 00:47:22,423000
I have to go now.

471
00:47:23,382000 --> 00:47:25,634000
I start work at 9:00.

472
00:47:27,136000 --> 00:47:29,889000
I have to wait for my passport.

473
00:47:30,556000 --> 00:47:33,100000
I'll come by your place tomorrow evening.

474
00:47:35,436000 --> 00:47:37,229000
I'll be waiting.

475
00:48:00,586000 --> 00:48:02,254000
Come with me.

476
00:48:02,588000 --> 00:48:04,090000
Why?

477
00:48:04,590000 --> 00:48:07,176000
There's something suspicious about your papers.

478
00:48:13,933000 --> 00:48:17,019000
You've resided in France for three years with no visa,

479
00:48:17,144000 --> 00:48:19,814000
no residence permit, no work permit.

480
00:48:20,481000 --> 00:48:23,484000
You claim you came by train from Spain,

481
00:48:23,609000 --> 00:48:26,195000
but you choose to say nothing more.

482
00:48:28,280000 --> 00:48:31,283000
There is nothing more to say.

483
00:48:31,409000 --> 00:48:32,952000
Very well.

484
00:48:33,244000 --> 00:48:35,538000
You'll spend the night here.

485
00:48:36,288000 --> 00:48:39,667000
We'll decide your fate in the morning.

486
00:48:41,669000 --> 00:48:43,671000
May I make a call?

487
00:48:43,796000 --> 00:48:47,258000
My dog is home alone. - In the morning.

488
00:49:32,887000 --> 00:49:35,890000
You're to be deported immediately to Albania.

489
00:49:36,557000 --> 00:49:39,518000
The flight for Athens leaves in two hours.

490
00:49:39,643000 --> 00:49:42,229000
If you're found within France's borders again

491
00:49:42,354000 --> 00:49:44,148000
without the necessary papers,

492
00:49:44,273000 --> 00:49:47,568000
it will mean six months in jail.

493
00:49:48,777000 --> 00:49:51,906000
May I make a call now?

494
00:49:52,198000 --> 00:49:53,991000
Make it fast.

495
00:50:00,998000 --> 00:50:03,375000
Mimi hasn't arrived yet.

496
00:50:04,251000 --> 00:50:05,920000
I don't know.

497
00:50:07,922000 --> 00:50:10,299000
Try again in a couple of hours.

498
00:50:13,594000 --> 00:50:15,387000
Morning, Henri.

499
00:50:15,513000 --> 00:50:17,306000
- Someone just called for you. - Who?

500
00:50:17,431000 --> 00:50:18,849000
He didn't say.

501
00:50:18,974000 --> 00:50:20,976000
Could you make me a coffee?

502
00:50:30,736000 --> 00:50:31,987000
<i>Listen...</i>

503
00:50:32,112000 --> 00:50:34,114000
I'm being deported.

504
00:50:34,907000 --> 00:50:38,118000
Will you look after Baudelaire and my paintings?

505
00:50:39,787000 --> 00:50:41,830000
I won't be coming back.

506
00:50:43,624000 --> 00:50:47,127000
They'll put me in jail if I do.

507
00:50:48,003000 --> 00:50:49,129000
Understand?

508
00:50:53,759000 --> 00:50:55,553000
Good-bye, Rodolfo.

509
00:50:59,974000 --> 00:51:01,976000
- A Suze. - Problems?

510
00:51:02,101000 --> 00:51:03,852000
No. Just thirsty.

511
00:51:38,512000 --> 00:51:40,514000
What do you think?

512
00:51:40,973000 --> 00:51:42,391000
1,800 francs.

513
00:51:42,516000 --> 00:51:46,145000
Only 19,000 miles. It has brakes...

514
00:51:47,438000 --> 00:51:49,106000
and everything.

515
00:51:50,149000 --> 00:51:51,567000
Great.

516
00:51:51,692000 --> 00:51:53,777000
Are you free this evening?

517
00:51:54,236000 --> 00:51:57,531000
What's bothering you? You don't seem too enthusiastic.

518
00:51:57,656000 --> 00:52:00,367000
Rodolfds been deported. No papers.

519
00:52:01,368000 --> 00:52:02,578000
Shit.

520
00:52:02,703000 --> 00:52:04,538000
I'll go get Baudelaire.

521
00:52:04,705000 --> 00:52:08,042000
Let's meet there tonight and haul his paintings to your place.

522
00:52:08,167000 --> 00:52:09,710000
All right.

523
00:52:31,565000 --> 00:52:33,233000
Evening, ma'am.

524
00:52:53,754000 --> 00:52:56,799000
- Are you looking for Rodolfo? - Yes.

525
00:52:56,924000 --> 00:52:59,760000
We were to meet here. Where is he?

526
00:53:00,094000 --> 00:53:03,263000
He's been deported. He was in the country illegally.

527
00:53:03,430000 --> 00:53:04,682000
When?

528
00:53:04,807000 --> 00:53:06,141000
This afternoon.

529
00:53:06,266000 --> 00:53:08,268000
Is he coming back?

530
00:53:08,977000 --> 00:53:10,646000
I don't know.

531
00:53:11,814000 --> 00:53:13,315000
I have to go.

532
00:53:13,440000 --> 00:53:15,776000
Shut the door when you leave.

533
00:53:45,806000 --> 00:53:48,976000
SPRING

534
00:54:43,739000 --> 00:54:46,325000
Hello, Musette. How's it going?

535
00:54:47,117000 --> 00:54:49,119000
What's it look like?

536
00:54:51,079000 --> 00:54:52,873000
How many today?

537
00:54:52,998000 --> 00:54:55,334000
We have to go to press Friday.

538
00:54:55,459000 --> 00:54:58,754000
Just one, but a full page. For Printemps.

539
00:54:58,879000 --> 00:55:01,965000
I know. They called and cancelled it.

540
00:55:02,090000 --> 00:55:06,720000
Coffee originated in Arabia, where it was discovered by a goat.

541
00:55:06,845000 --> 00:55:10,891000
Balzac drank 70 cups a day.

542
00:55:11,183000 --> 00:55:13,936000
What are you up to with that ladder?

543
00:55:14,895000 --> 00:55:17,856000
It's the link between me and my beloved.

544
00:55:17,981000 --> 00:55:20,067000
Have you read Shakespeare?

545
00:55:20,234000 --> 00:55:23,195000
Of course. He was a great philosopher.

546
00:55:23,320000 --> 00:55:26,865000
Do you remember <i>Romeo and Juliet?</i>

547
00:55:27,241000 --> 00:55:29,201000
Do I remember it?

548
00:55:29,326000 --> 00:55:31,995000
“It was the nightingale and not the lark

549
00:55:32,120000 --> 00:55:36,375000
that pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear.”

550
00:55:36,500000 --> 00:55:38,627000
Don't you understand?

551
00:55:39,044000 --> 00:55:41,672000
I've met a girl from a good family,

552
00:55:41,797000 --> 00:55:45,092000
but for certain reasons her father can't stand me

553
00:55:45,259000 --> 00:55:47,386000
and has threatened to kill me.

554
00:55:47,511000 --> 00:55:49,513000
The girl's name is Juliette,

555
00:55:49,638000 --> 00:55:52,766000
and her room just happens to have a balcony.

556
00:55:52,891000 --> 00:55:55,477000
I came to borrow this bird

557
00:55:55,602000 --> 00:55:59,606000
to wake me every morning before the old man gets up.

558
00:56:00,357000 --> 00:56:04,111000
I'd be obliged if from now on you'd call me

559
00:56:04,278000 --> 00:56:06,405000
Romeo Montague.

560
00:56:07,614000 --> 00:56:09,783000
What do you think of my plan?

561
00:56:13,871000 --> 00:56:16,290000
<i>The Sash of Iris,</i> hello.

562
00:56:17,749000 --> 00:56:20,127000
It's for you, Marcel, from abroad.

563
00:56:25,382000 --> 00:56:26,884000
All right.

564
00:56:28,427000 --> 00:56:29,970000
Where?

565
00:56:31,263000 --> 00:56:32,764000
What time?

566
00:56:35,309000 --> 00:56:36,810000
Very well.

567
00:56:38,020000 --> 00:56:40,647000
Forget about your Juliette. We have to go.

568
00:56:40,814000 --> 00:56:42,649000
- Where? - The border.

569
00:56:42,816000 --> 00:56:44,818000
I'll explain on the way.

570
00:56:47,112000 --> 00:56:50,365000
Let me have a few hundred. - There is no money.

571
00:56:50,490000 --> 00:56:51,992000
Where did it all go?

572
00:56:52,159000 --> 00:56:54,745000
I paid the printer so they'd give me the magazines.

573
00:56:54,870000 --> 00:56:56,872000
You could have left them there.

574
00:56:56,997000 --> 00:56:59,374000
We need a picture for the cover.

575
00:57:09,593000 --> 00:57:11,094000
Hold still.

576
00:57:19,811000 --> 00:57:21,396000
Now let's go.

577
00:58:12,072000 --> 00:58:13,407000
There he is.

578
00:58:47,691000 --> 00:58:51,111000
Shall we go? We can make Paris by morning.

579
01:00:51,439000 --> 01:00:54,317000
- When is Mimi in? - Mimi isn't here anymore.

580
01:00:54,442000 --> 01:00:57,070000
But they stop in almost every evening.

581
01:00:57,237000 --> 01:00:58,488000
Who's “they”?

582
01:00:58,613000 --> 01:01:02,117000
Mimi and Francis, her boyfriend. Why do you ask?

583
01:01:02,909000 --> 01:01:04,911000
I'm an old friend.

584
01:01:06,371000 --> 01:01:07,664000
Thank you.

585
01:01:52,834000 --> 01:01:54,419000
Good evening.

586
01:01:54,544000 --> 01:01:56,254000
How are you? - Fine.

587
01:01:56,379000 --> 01:01:58,381000
Someone was asking for you. - Who?

588
01:01:58,506000 --> 01:02:01,134000
An old friend. He's sitting over there.

589
01:03:27,345000 --> 01:03:30,015000
I believe The Crossing of the Red Sea

590
01:03:30,140000 --> 01:03:31,766000
is finished.

591
01:03:32,225000 --> 01:03:34,019000
I feel empty.

592
01:03:34,311000 --> 01:03:38,273000
If you manage to sell it, we can pay the rent.

593
01:03:38,940000 --> 01:03:41,776000
Perhaps you could come down on the price.

594
01:03:42,610000 --> 01:03:45,447000
I won't sell it for less

595
01:03:45,572000 --> 01:03:47,198000
than 200 francs.

596
01:03:47,324000 --> 01:03:49,743000
I've already put

597
01:03:49,909000 --> 01:03:52,787000
over 10,000 francs' worth of paint into it.

598
01:03:52,912000 --> 01:03:55,415000
What if the landlord calls the police?

599
01:03:55,540000 --> 01:03:58,335000
You still don't have a residence permit.

600
01:03:59,711000 --> 01:04:01,588000
Come in.

601
01:04:16,519000 --> 01:04:18,271000
What a surprise.

602
01:04:21,608000 --> 01:04:25,362000
Would you offer our guest a glass of water?

603
01:04:29,074000 --> 01:04:30,950000
To what do I owe this honor?

604
01:04:31,076000 --> 01:04:33,078000
I was so inspired by your portrait

605
01:04:33,203000 --> 01:04:36,122000
that I've decided to become a collector.

606
01:04:36,289000 --> 01:04:39,334000
I'm now looking for a relatively large painting,

607
01:04:39,793000 --> 01:04:41,628000
and I thought of you.

608
01:04:41,753000 --> 01:04:43,463000
You're in luck.

609
01:04:43,630000 --> 01:04:47,801000
I just finished this one and intended to send it off

610
01:04:47,926000 --> 01:04:50,678000
in the morning with some other works

611
01:04:50,804000 --> 01:04:53,348000
to an exhibition in New York.

612
01:04:53,640000 --> 01:04:56,601000
But if you'd care to make an offer...

613
01:04:57,227000 --> 01:04:59,479000
as an old customer...

614
01:05:00,814000 --> 01:05:03,024000
I like the work very much.

615
01:05:03,525000 --> 01:05:05,819000
I'll give you 1,000 francs.

616
01:05:06,986000 --> 01:05:09,072000
- You're joking. - 1,200.

617
01:05:09,197000 --> 01:05:10,365000
2,000.

618
01:05:10,490000 --> 01:05:11,991000
1,400.

619
01:05:12,117000 --> 01:05:13,910000
1,700.

620
01:05:14,327000 --> 01:05:16,162000
1,500...

621
01:05:17,705000 --> 01:05:20,542000
and two tickets to the opera this evening.

622
01:05:22,627000 --> 01:05:26,381000
Opera is a dying art form, but all right.

623
01:05:45,775000 --> 01:05:48,987000
Go pay the rent and then get dressed.

624
01:05:49,779000 --> 01:05:52,490000
You and Musette can go to the opera.

625
01:05:57,662000 --> 01:05:59,873000
I'll wait outside.

626
01:06:00,498000 --> 01:06:03,042000
I have to talk to Marcel.

627
01:06:59,307000 --> 01:07:01,226000
Poor girls.

628
01:07:01,351000 --> 01:07:04,229000
They were never meant to live like this.

629
01:07:05,271000 --> 01:07:08,608000
Being men, and thus stronger in every respect,

630
01:07:08,775000 --> 01:07:11,528000
we bear up joyfully under every misfortune.

631
01:07:11,653000 --> 01:07:13,696000
We don't sink into depression

632
01:07:13,821000 --> 01:07:17,283000
if our outfit isn't always neat and tidy.

633
01:07:17,450000 --> 01:07:20,328000
But for women it's different.

634
01:07:20,954000 --> 01:07:25,333000
The simplest frock brings them joy, and one can't fault them for that.

635
01:07:25,583000 --> 01:07:27,168000
On the other hand,

636
01:07:27,293000 --> 01:07:31,548000
the market for art and literature has been bustling recently.

637
01:07:32,757000 --> 01:07:34,968000
We'll soon be earning

638
01:07:35,134000 --> 01:07:38,846000
nearly as much as porters at the Gare de L'Est.

639
01:07:38,972000 --> 01:07:40,515000
It's true.

640
01:07:41,307000 --> 01:07:44,435000
Works of art are selling like pancakes.

641
01:07:44,561000 --> 01:07:46,145000
Then it's agreed.

642
01:07:46,312000 --> 01:07:50,316000
Tomorrow we take the girls shopping to indulge their feminine whims.

643
01:07:50,441000 --> 01:07:53,653000
Sunday we'll go on a picnic in the countryside.

644
01:07:54,821000 --> 01:07:56,364000
What about me?

645
01:07:56,489000 --> 01:07:59,158000
You have two days to find yourself a companion.

646
01:07:59,284000 --> 01:08:03,204000
It's not our fault if your appearance sparks no interest in the opposite sex.

647
01:08:03,329000 --> 01:08:06,165000
But if you have no luck, you can still come along...

648
01:08:06,374000 --> 01:08:08,042000
as our driver.

649
01:08:10,128000 --> 01:08:14,048000
Monsieur, there's a call for you in the kitchen.

650
01:08:15,216000 --> 01:08:16,676000
Madame...

651
01:08:16,843000 --> 01:08:20,346000
your eyes are like two moons.

652
01:08:33,693000 --> 01:08:37,113000
Let's hope it doesn't come to more than 600 francs.

653
01:11:06,679000 --> 01:11:08,681000
And never come back!

654
01:11:10,516000 --> 01:11:12,518000
They didn't like it?

655
01:11:13,519000 --> 01:11:15,188000
Idiots!

656
01:11:15,563000 --> 01:11:18,107000
They tried to discourage me.

657
01:11:18,232000 --> 01:11:21,235000
They said I should break my brushes in two

658
01:11:21,360000 --> 01:11:23,696000
and jump out the window.

659
01:11:27,033000 --> 01:11:29,952000
Let's go borrow some money from Marcel

660
01:11:30,077000 --> 01:11:32,288000
and go out to eat.

661
01:11:48,554000 --> 01:11:50,306000
I gave you

662
01:11:50,431000 --> 01:11:53,392000
a cash advance.

663
01:11:55,061000 --> 01:11:57,647000
I want it back

664
01:11:57,772000 --> 01:11:59,232000
in two days.

665
01:11:59,357000 --> 01:12:01,400000
Not three or five.

666
01:12:01,567000 --> 01:12:03,236000
Two days.

667
01:12:04,403000 --> 01:12:06,072000
Good luck...

668
01:12:07,114000 --> 01:12:08,741000
and good-bye.

669
01:12:26,592000 --> 01:12:28,594000
What was that all about?

670
01:12:28,719000 --> 01:12:31,138000
He's mad that I serialized my play.

671
01:12:31,264000 --> 01:12:35,601000
Says it didn't suit the magazine's style and that readers complained.

672
01:12:35,768000 --> 01:12:37,436000
What readers?

673
01:12:37,603000 --> 01:12:40,773000
Besides, as editor in chief, I set the style.

674
01:12:40,940000 --> 01:12:43,609000
He was just the publisher. Capitalist!

675
01:12:43,776000 --> 01:12:45,987000
- I'm hungry. - Me too.

676
01:12:46,696000 --> 01:12:48,698000
Come eat at my place.

677
01:12:48,865000 --> 01:12:51,158000
I happen to have a little money.

678
01:12:51,450000 --> 01:12:53,077000
While we're at it,

679
01:12:53,202000 --> 01:12:56,080000
I can play my latest composition for you.

680
01:15:30,109000 --> 01:15:32,445000
I'm going to leave Marcel.

681
01:15:34,196000 --> 01:15:35,781000
When?

682
01:15:35,906000 --> 01:15:37,575000
Tonight.

683
01:15:38,492000 --> 01:15:40,453000
I've already packed.

684
01:15:42,705000 --> 01:15:44,665000
Does he know?

685
01:15:47,251000 --> 01:15:49,420000
I didn't dare tell him.

686
01:15:51,922000 --> 01:15:54,091000
I'm going back to Strasbourg.

687
01:15:54,383000 --> 01:15:56,343000
There's this farmer there.

688
01:15:56,469000 --> 01:15:59,305000
He's not great-looking, but he's sweet...

689
01:16:00,222000 --> 01:16:01,932000
and dependable.

690
01:16:03,726000 --> 01:16:05,227000
Why?

691
01:16:07,063000 --> 01:16:09,065000
Marcel doesn't need me.

692
01:16:12,651000 --> 01:16:14,361000
All he loves is his books.

693
01:16:15,863000 --> 01:16:19,492000
Yesterday I pawned my ring for rent money.

694
01:16:19,617000 --> 01:16:23,621000
I left the money on the table. When I came back, he'd taken it...

695
01:16:24,622000 --> 01:16:27,583000
and spent it all on first-edition Balzacs.

696
01:16:27,708000 --> 01:16:29,210000
Poor Marcel.

697
01:16:31,921000 --> 01:16:34,256000
He'll forget me in a week.

698
01:16:36,467000 --> 01:16:39,512000
In any case, quicker than I'll forget him.

699
01:16:43,140000 --> 01:16:45,059000
That's how men are.

700
01:16:46,435000 --> 01:16:49,563000
Will you see me to the station? - Of course.

701
01:16:49,855000 --> 01:16:51,524000
I'll miss you.

702
01:16:51,774000 --> 01:16:53,734000
You must come visit!

703
01:16:53,859000 --> 01:16:55,736000
I'll send you the fare.

704
01:16:55,861000 --> 01:16:57,655000
The man's rich.

705
01:16:57,780000 --> 01:16:59,782000
I promise.

706
01:17:00,324000 --> 01:17:02,660000
Write to me care of general delivery.

707
01:17:02,993000 --> 01:17:04,870000
Why general delivery?

708
01:17:06,497000 --> 01:17:08,040000
I don't know.

709
01:18:13,772000 --> 01:18:15,858000
How's it going, Mimi?

710
01:18:16,275000 --> 01:18:17,568000
Fine.

711
01:18:17,693000 --> 01:18:19,278000
Can I give you a ride?

712
01:18:21,280000 --> 01:18:23,365000
You can drive me home.

713
01:18:44,136000 --> 01:18:45,638000
Yes, darling.

714
01:18:46,639000 --> 01:18:48,682000
I found work.

715
01:18:50,392000 --> 01:18:52,728000
You needn't have.

716
01:18:52,937000 --> 01:18:56,148000
I can't go on living like this, never having any money.

717
01:18:56,273000 --> 01:18:58,984000
I can't breathe. It's like I'm suffocating.

718
01:18:59,109000 --> 01:19:01,445000
I'll open the window.

719
01:19:01,737000 --> 01:19:03,364000
That won't help.

720
01:19:03,489000 --> 01:19:06,033000
Besides, it's already cold in here.

721
01:19:07,076000 --> 01:19:09,870000
Shall I light a fire in the stove?

722
01:19:11,038000 --> 01:19:13,499000
There's no wood or coal.

723
01:19:24,510000 --> 01:19:26,595000
Some old poems of mine.

724
01:19:27,304000 --> 01:19:30,432000
I thought I'd publish a collection...

725
01:19:30,933000 --> 01:19:32,559000
someday.

726
01:19:54,707000 --> 01:19:59,211000
At least they'll provide some heat.

727
01:20:02,589000 --> 01:20:04,717000
I'm going for a little walk.

728
01:20:08,304000 --> 01:20:10,556000
Don't be too long.

729
01:21:48,695000 --> 01:21:50,656000
Hello, Rodolfo.

730
01:21:50,781000 --> 01:21:52,533000
Hello, Mimi.

731
01:21:53,742000 --> 01:21:55,828000
I love you, you know,

732
01:21:55,994000 --> 01:21:58,122000
but life is hard.

733
01:21:59,998000 --> 01:22:02,793000
Yes. I understand.

734
01:22:28,861000 --> 01:22:30,863000
<i>I drink.</i>

735
01:22:31,196000 --> 01:22:33,615000
<i>Glass after glass</i>

736
01:22:34,867000 --> 01:22:39,079000
<i>To forget all about my wife's friends</i>

737
01:22:41,748000 --> 01:22:44,418000
<i>I drink.</i>

738
01:22:44,543000 --> 01:22:46,879000
<i>Glass after glass</i>

739
01:22:48,505000 --> 01:22:53,844000
<i>To forget all my troubles</i>

740
01:22:55,345000 --> 01:22:57,806000
<i>I drink.</i>

741
01:22:58,182000 --> 01:23:01,018000
<i>Any old swill</i>

742
01:23:02,060000 --> 01:23:07,357000
<i>As long as it's strong</i>

743
01:23:08,692000 --> 01:23:10,986000
<i>I drink.</i>

744
01:23:11,445000 --> 01:23:13,822000
<i>The cheapest stuff</i>

745
01:23:15,324000 --> 01:23:17,576000
<i>It's rough</i>

746
01:23:17,743000 --> 01:23:20,454000
<i>But it passes the time</i>

747
01:23:22,372000 --> 01:23:25,417000
<i>Is life really such a lark?</i>

748
01:23:25,667000 --> 01:23:28,921000
<i>Is it really so exciting?</i>

749
01:23:29,046000 --> 01:23:32,716000
<i>I ask</i>

750
01:23:32,841000 --> 01:23:34,510000
<i>Those two questions</i>

751
01:23:34,635000 --> 01:23:36,595000
AUTUMN

752
01:23:36,720000 --> 01:23:38,931000
<i>Is it worth living?</i>

753
01:23:39,306000 --> 01:23:42,684000
<i>Or loving, only to be cheated on?</i>

754
01:23:42,809000 --> 01:23:45,938000
<i>I ask those two questions</i>

755
01:23:47,606000 --> 01:23:51,360000
<i>But no one ever answers</i>

756
01:23:51,485000 --> 01:23:54,238000
<i>And so I drink</i>

757
01:23:54,363000 --> 01:23:56,615000
<i>Glass after glass</i>

758
01:24:10,879000 --> 01:24:12,381000
What?

759
01:24:13,006000 --> 01:24:14,508000
Nothing.

760
01:24:32,150000 --> 01:24:34,152000
It's very good.

761
01:24:38,240000 --> 01:24:41,660000
The voice of the people is the voice of God.

762
01:24:41,785000 --> 01:24:43,996000
EVEN MOSES USED BLANCHERON SUGAR

763
01:24:51,545000 --> 01:24:54,881000
That there is known as turkey with truffles.

764
01:24:56,550000 --> 01:24:59,344000
Look at the color of that leg of lamb!

765
01:24:59,511000 --> 01:25:02,139000
Lamb is the favorite food of the gods

766
01:25:02,264000 --> 01:25:05,183000
and also of my godmother, Madame Chandlier.

767
01:25:06,560000 --> 01:25:08,186000
And what about those trout?

768
01:25:08,312000 --> 01:25:10,439000
They're superb swimmers.

769
01:25:10,981000 --> 01:25:13,358000
They climb rapids as quickly

770
01:25:13,525000 --> 01:25:16,862000
as we'd accept an invitation to dinner this evening.

771
01:25:17,029000 --> 01:25:19,197000
That fruit is known as pineapple.

772
01:25:20,240000 --> 01:25:23,035000
I almost got to taste one once.

773
01:25:24,244000 --> 01:25:26,038000
Speaking of fruit,

774
01:25:26,204000 --> 01:25:29,207000
I wouldn't say no to that pheasant there.

775
01:25:29,374000 --> 01:25:32,169000
Why this profusion of delicacies?

776
01:25:32,753000 --> 01:25:36,048000
You don't know? It's All Saints' Day,

777
01:25:36,840000 --> 01:25:39,217000
a great family celebration.

778
01:25:39,843000 --> 01:25:42,554000
Would you care to spend the evening with me?

779
01:25:43,889000 --> 01:25:45,390000
No money.

780
01:25:45,599000 --> 01:25:47,643000
How much have you got?

781
01:26:29,226000 --> 01:26:31,728000
I don't understand. I've lost my appetite.

782
01:26:34,439000 --> 01:26:35,941000
Same here.

783
01:26:39,486000 --> 01:26:41,321000
I can see

784
01:26:41,446000 --> 01:26:45,742000
that a phantom from the past sits at this table.

785
01:26:46,618000 --> 01:26:51,373000
But if you intend to waste away to nothing,

786
01:26:51,498000 --> 01:26:54,793000
you could do so just as well on a full stomach.

787
01:27:09,558000 --> 01:27:11,560000
Am I disturbing you?

788
01:27:12,894000 --> 01:27:14,354000
Come in.

789
01:27:24,823000 --> 01:27:26,658000
I'm so cold.

790
01:27:27,826000 --> 01:27:30,454000
I happened to be passing by

791
01:27:30,579000 --> 01:27:33,039000
and saw the light in the window.

792
01:27:34,541000 --> 01:27:37,627000
I lost my apartment a week ago,

793
01:27:37,753000 --> 01:27:40,422000
and I've been wandering the streets ever since.

794
01:27:41,339000 --> 01:27:43,842000
I'm posing for artists these days,

795
01:27:44,009000 --> 01:27:46,011000
but it doesn't pay much.

796
01:27:47,512000 --> 01:27:50,223000
Oh, I only show my face and hands.

797
01:27:52,642000 --> 01:27:55,187000
They've promised to pay me tomorrow.

798
01:27:56,646000 --> 01:27:59,357000
Then I'll move back into my apartment.

799
01:28:08,033000 --> 01:28:10,994000
- Where are you two going? - To get some cigars.

800
01:28:11,119000 --> 01:28:12,454000
In Havana.

801
01:28:12,579000 --> 01:28:14,539000
We'll be back tomorrow

802
01:28:14,706000 --> 01:28:17,292000
sure as arrows loosed by a steady hand.

803
01:28:30,889000 --> 01:28:32,682000
Where have you been?

804
01:28:32,808000 --> 01:28:35,393000
Don't ask any questions.

805
01:28:36,186000 --> 01:28:39,022000
Just let me sit here by your side.

806
01:28:39,648000 --> 01:28:41,733000
It's so warm here.

807
01:28:43,860000 --> 01:28:46,988000
I'll stay until tomorrow. All right?

808
01:28:47,489000 --> 01:28:49,991000
It's going to be very cold here.

809
01:28:50,450000 --> 01:28:51,952000
Good.

810
01:28:52,619000 --> 01:28:55,455000
It'll be just like before.

811
01:28:56,665000 --> 01:28:58,750000
I'll clear the table.

812
01:29:03,088000 --> 01:29:05,257000
The warmth has made me dizzy.

813
01:29:05,674000 --> 01:29:07,759000
I can hardly stand up.

814
01:29:14,432000 --> 01:29:16,351000
You have a fever.

815
01:29:16,977000 --> 01:29:20,021000
I'll help you into bed.

816
01:30:17,162000 --> 01:30:20,749000
Schaunard and I will go get a doctor.

817
01:30:21,499000 --> 01:30:23,084000
You stay here

818
01:30:23,209000 --> 01:30:25,211000
and keep Mimi company.

819
01:30:44,522000 --> 01:30:46,858000
I was awake the whole time.

820
01:30:47,943000 --> 01:30:50,195000
Rodolfo still loves me.

821
01:30:50,320000 --> 01:30:52,072000
What about you?

822
01:30:52,197000 --> 01:30:54,658000
I never stopped loving him.

823
01:30:54,783000 --> 01:30:56,493000
Then all is well.

824
01:30:58,453000 --> 01:31:00,872000
I'm going away forever.

825
01:31:01,998000 --> 01:31:03,792000
What are you talking about?

826
01:31:05,210000 --> 01:31:07,379000
I'm going to die soon.

827
01:31:08,129000 --> 01:31:09,631000
Look.

828
01:31:15,303000 --> 01:31:17,305000
You believe me now?

829
01:31:19,224000 --> 01:31:21,893000
If I'd stayed here

830
01:31:22,060000 --> 01:31:23,895000
with Rodolfo,

831
01:31:24,020000 --> 01:31:26,356000
everything would be fine now.

832
01:31:28,066000 --> 01:31:29,818000
Poor Rodolfo.

833
01:31:30,902000 --> 01:31:33,863000
He has to take care of me once again.

834
01:31:34,990000 --> 01:31:37,075000
But not for long.

835
01:31:39,119000 --> 01:31:42,372000
The last dress he buys me will be white.

836
01:31:43,331000 --> 01:31:45,917000
Don't talk like that. You'll get better.

837
01:31:46,418000 --> 01:31:48,837000
Rodolfo has gone for a doctor.

838
01:31:50,797000 --> 01:31:53,758000
It took me an hour to climb the stairs yesterday.

839
01:31:54,342000 --> 01:31:57,595000
But if I'd found another woman here with him,

840
01:31:57,762000 --> 01:32:00,432000
I'd have thrown myself right out the window.

841
01:32:02,142000 --> 01:32:04,185000
Rodolfo knows everything.

842
01:32:43,099000 --> 01:32:46,352000
She must go to the hospital - my hospital.

843
01:32:46,478000 --> 01:32:48,480000
I'll call an ambulance.

844
01:32:51,733000 --> 01:32:53,568000
I have a car.

845
01:33:34,317000 --> 01:33:36,444000
You must be brave.

846
01:33:37,862000 --> 01:33:41,116000
I can ease her pain, but I can't save her.

847
01:33:42,867000 --> 01:33:46,371000
She'll live until spring at the latest.

848
01:33:48,373000 --> 01:33:50,708000
I can keep her in a private room,

849
01:33:50,875000 --> 01:33:52,877000
but I must warn you:

850
01:33:53,711000 --> 01:33:57,382000
Though it may seem cruel, it's very expensive.

851
01:34:02,178000 --> 01:34:04,180000
I'll find the money.

852
01:34:25,410000 --> 01:34:27,745000
Who painted this? Becker?

853
01:36:08,012000 --> 01:36:10,014000
Open the curtains.

854
01:36:12,433000 --> 01:36:15,812000
Spring is here, and I want to look outside.

855
01:36:35,290000 --> 01:36:37,709000
It's so grey in here.

856
01:36:41,170000 --> 01:36:44,173000
Why don't you pick me some flowers?

857
01:39:17,535000 --> 01:39:19,412000
She's dead.

858
01:39:21,998000 --> 01:39:23,875000
Shall we come with you?

859
01:39:24,000000 --> 01:39:25,877000
That's all right.

860
01:39:26,335000 --> 01:39:28,671000
I need to be alone.
