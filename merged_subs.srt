Already? How time rushes on!

24
00:06:58,092000 --> 00:07:00,754000
You're a bit slow in vacating the premises.

It's already 11:30.

29
00:07:14,017000 --> 00:07:19,105000
你还没有交3个月的房租
your three months' back rent. Would you mind? - Of course not.

Then kindly step into my office, so I may give you a receipt.
我会付清的 如果你到事务所  我会给你开单

I must go to the bank. I don't carry a sum like that on me.
不去银行就没有钱给你

33
00:07:33,122000 --> 00:07:36,456000
I see. No cash.

Then allow me to relieve you of that little burden

35
00:07:39,793000 --> 00:07:45,340000

so it doesn't tire you. You think I'd carry off my belongings in a bag?

36
00:07:44,142000 --> 00:07:47,342000
Those are the rules.
这是规矩

37
00:07:46,142000 --> 00:07:50,804000
You're not to remove so much as a single hair until the rent is paid.

His accomplice is around the corner in an Alfa Romeo, reading <i>Le Monde -</i> upside down.

I only wish to do my duty.

What do you suppose is in his bag?

Has my apartment been vacated?

给我半份鳟鱼

80
00:11:48,382000 --> 00:11:50,877000

奇怪的要求

81
00:11:50,382000 --> 00:11:55,340000
那是经过计算之后得出来的
On the contrary. This method yields on average

82

a quarter more than ordering a full portion.

I'm afraid this gentleman got the last trout.

May I invite you to partake of this course with me?

That I couldn't allow.

有两个头双头  原本是希腊语

94
00:13:00,405000 --> 00:13:06,452000
怎么会有双头的鳟鱼
a word which comes from the Greek and means...

95
00:13:05,076000 --> 00:13:07,120000
precisely that.

96
00:13:08,462000 --> 00:13:13,462000
Nevertheless, I harbor no regrets about eating this phenomenon.
吃一些奇形怪状的鱼  已经很普遍

97
00:13:21,384000 --> 00:13:23,482000
The sauce was delicious.

98
00:13:23,482000 --> 00:13:28,099000
我也这么认为

99
00:13:27,482000 --> 00:13:31,311000
and its fine reputation is richly deserved.

and have lived in Paris only three years now.
住在巴黎已经有3年了

that I see to the coffee and the rest.
咖啡由我自己拿

110
00:14:03,522000 --> 00:14:07,263000
As a painter, don't you think
作为画家你有什么意见

111
00:14:05,522000 --> 00:14:09,766000
that Malevich's <i>Black</i> Square
就像马雷奇  改变绘画的方向一样

112
00:14:09,932000 --> 00:14:12,185000
is as lethal a blow to painting

113
00:14:12,310000 --> 00:14:17,482000
肖恩等流派的人
as the school of Vienna - Schoenberg, Berg, Webern, and the rest - is to music?

114
00:14:16,532000 --> 00:14:20,532000
- I agree entirely. - Let's go.
改变了音乐 要走了

115
00:14:32,455000 --> 00:14:36,793000
我住在附近  到我那里继续说吧
I live just around the corner. We may continue our discussion there.

116
00:14:40,562000 --> 00:14:45,551000
"我喝醉了  坐在船上在河上行驶"
“I floated down impassive rivers, unguided now by bargemen's hands.

He and Verlaine argued vehemently about -

120
00:14:58,481000 --> 00:15:01,401000
Anyway, come inside.

This is where I live.
这里就是我家

132
00:15:04,582000 --> 00:15:06,572000
谢谢

122

Strange. The key's in the lock,
