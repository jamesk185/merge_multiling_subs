But sending a debt collector so suddenly, is that right?

00:25:01,500000 --> 00:25:04,585000
I told you we went to the hodja's? You know, our tenant.
今天我们去见租户霍加...

276
00:25:04,750000 --> 00:25:05,667000
Yes?
嗯

277
00:25:05,830000 --> 00:25:09,171000
If you saw how filthy it was, how messy.
你应该看看屋子有多脏多乱

278
00:25:09,840000 --> 00:25:12,594000
- Did you go in? - No, I mean the garden.
-你进去了  -没有  就看了看花园

279
00:25:13,840000 --> 00:25:14,841000
They've ruined it.
房子都快毁了

280
00:25:15,800000 --> 00:25:19,175000
A woman lives there too, but you wouldn't think so.
可是家里还有个女人住呢

281
00:25:20,310000 --> 00:25:23,015000
First of all, you are a man of God.
为了保持信仰

282
00:25:23,180000 --> 00:25:26,557000
You should be a model to your community.
我们要对群体做出模范

283
00:25:26,770000 --> 00:25:28,610000
Shouldn't you be neat and tidy?

284
00:25:29,020000 --> 00:25:31,020000
Who is he? Do I know him?

285
00:25:31,480000 --> 00:25:32,603000
No, you wouldn't.
不认识

286
00:25:33,110000 --> 00:25:36,151000
An old tenant from back in my father's day.
我爸爸那时候的老租户

287
00:25:37,030000 --> 00:25:38,992000
I'd walk past him in the street.
在街上碰见我都认不出

288
00:25:39,330000 --> 00:25:41,821000
Just a crooked, shabby guy.

289
00:25:42,540000 --> 00:25:44,451000
I don't know...
我不知道...

290
00:25:44,620000 --> 00:25:48,291000
Shouldn't men of God be a model to the public?
有了模范人们才有信仰  不是吗

291
00:25:48,710000 --> 00:25:50,588000
Especially in rural areas.
尤其是在乡下

292
00:25:51,630000 --> 00:25:54,634000
Perhaps I should write about that next week?
也许我应该把这个写下来

293
00:25:54,800000 --> 00:25:57,259000
The very thought of him gets on my nerves.
光是想想这个事我就要疯了

294
00:25:59,390000 --> 00:26:02,178000
Of course, write about anything you want.
想些什么就写吧

295
00:26:02,350000 --> 00:26:03,930000
But...
还有

296
00:26:04,730000 --> 00:26:08,644000
Wouldn't it be better to write for a bigger paper
为一家大报纸写作

297
00:26:08,810000 --> 00:26:10,980000
instead of a local one nobody reads?
总比为那破玩意写好吧

298
00:26:11,770000 --> 00:26:15,942000
Then at least it would be worth all your efforts.
看看你怎么逼自己的...

299
00:26:17,240000 --> 00:26:20,279000
I don't feel I'm making any efforts.
我没觉得有什么不好

300
00:26:20,870000 --> 00:26:25,663000
I mean, I hear you typing away in front of your computer all week.
我不懂  我看你整个礼拜都趴在电脑前

301
00:26:25,830000 --> 00:26:27,874000
That's why.
我觉得

302
00:26:29,330000 --> 00:26:32,588000
If you didn't bring me that paper,
如果你不和我说

303
00:26:32,750000 --> 00:26:36,260000
I wouldn't even know it existed.
我都不知道有这么个日志

304
00:26:36,590000 --> 00:26:37,840000
That's what I mean.
这就是原因

305
00:26:38,010000 --> 00:26:41,216000
Frankly, I don't give a damn about big papers.
我不在乎什么大报纸

306
00:26:42,470000 --> 00:26:45,975000
My kingdom may be small but at least I'm the king there.
我的王国诚然很小  但至少我还是王

307
00:26:47,140000 --> 00:26:49,271000
I mean, who's going to read this paper?
但是谁会读这杂志

308
00:26:50,230000 --> 00:26:51,900000
Who's going to buy it?
谁会买

309
00:26:52,110000 --> 00:26:55,230000
I don't agree with you, my dear Necla.
不好意思  亲爱的内吉纳  我不同意

310
00:26:55,400000 --> 00:26:57,280000
On the contrary.
一点也不同意

311
00:26:58,320000 --> 00:27:01,242000
Sometimes I receive letters from my readers
我收到了读者来信

312
00:27:01,700000 --> 00:27:04,574000
that prove to me I'm on the right path.
让我有信心继续做下去

313
00:27:05,458000 --> 00:27:07,664000
Even my efforts, as you say,
除了  如你所说  我有点逼自己以外

314
00:27:07,830000 --> 00:27:10,160000
feel more than worth it.
我觉得很值得

315
00:27:10,330000 --> 00:27:13,338000
- Take yesterday... - Yes but sometimes on the Internet,
-比如说  昨天  -对  但有时候在网上

316
00:27:13,500000 --> 00:27:16,550000
some awful writers get praised to high heaven.
很糟糕的作者也会被捧上天

317
00:27:17,590000 --> 00:27:20,168000
Everyone has their fans somehow.
每个人都会有自己的粉丝

318
00:27:21,470000 --> 00:27:25,767000
That's why I think one shouldn't take such praise so seriously.
别当真

319
00:27:26,311000 --> 00:27:29,681000
I mean, that shouldn't be your reference.
总之  别放心上

320
00:27:31,980000 --> 00:27:35,318000
Anyway, keep on writing. Don't let me distract you.
继续写吧  我不打扰你了

321

I'll just lie down here.

322
00:27:38,824000 --> 00:27:40,367000

走开

323

The mud makes driving up here hard.

324
00:28:12,020000 --> 00:28:14,146000
Why don't you lay some gravel?

325
00:28:14,276000 --> 00:28:17,230000
The tourists like it this way, it's more natural.
自然的东西吸引游客

326
00:28:17,940000 --> 00:28:22,240000
I didn't say asphalt, I said gravel. That's natural too.
也不是让你铺路啊  撒点石子很自然的

327
00:28:22,400000 --> 00:28:25,326000
With gravel, half the tourists wouldn't come.
撒了石子  顾客有一半会走

328
00:28:25,490000 --> 00:28:29,160000
Very few clients in winter, in fact. Wouldn't be worth it.
本来冬天就没什么人...

329
00:28:29,917000 --> 00:28:32,455000
Of course nobody comes with this mud.

Don't want everyone here anyway.

My belly's declared independence.
我的胃不听我使唤了

What about that mass suicide around your hairline then?
你看你脑子里想法挺多

346
00:29:18,380000 --> 00:29:19,841000
It's no big deal, but...

You know that village, Garip, near your farm...

A girl from the public education office wrote to me.

Alright then, I will.

409
00:32:43,040000 --> 00:32:44,243000
Let me see.
嗯...

410
00:32:44,710000 --> 00:32:46,089000
Yes, here it is.
开始了

411
00:32:49,550000 --> 00:32:50,962000
"Dear Mr Aydin,
"亲爱的艾登先生

412
00:32:51,130000 --> 00:32:53,378000
I would like you to know that...
"首先  我必须告诉您

00:32:53,550000 --> 00:32:56,259000
I am a great admirer of you and your articles.

impatient to benefit from your vast experience and courageous ideas.
"您智慧而又大胆的想法令我受益

are proud that our town has such a valued citizen."
"很荣幸能与有您这样高度的人相遇..."

419
00:33:15,618000 --> 00:33:18,240000
Blah, blah, we can skip all this.
等等  等等  跳过这些...

420
00:33:19,870000 --> 00:33:21,035000
Yes... let's continue from there.
然后她说

421
00:33:21,200000 --> 00:33:23,497000
"We, a group of teachers,

The mukhtar helped as much as he could.

00:33:38,550000 --> 00:33:42,223000
However, despite all our efforts, our resources ran out
"即便已穷尽所有努力  一切资源

with the work not finished.

428
00:33:44,430000 --> 00:33:48,389000
We applied for support to the municipality, but we were rejected.
"区政府不肯资助我们

00:33:48,560000 --> 00:33:52,186000
We have been left helpless, all alone in the middle of this steppe,
"在广阔的草原里  我们被命运抛弃

with all our good intentions and hopes.

While we sat disheartened seeking a solution,

00:33:58,620000 --> 00:34:02,831000
I suddenly remembered your article "Flowers of the Steppes".
"然后我记起您的文章'草原野花'

It felt as if you were describing us.

Me and my friends read that article again in tears.

Believe me, my intention is not emotional blackmail.

00:35:01,300000 --> 00:35:02,885000
That's it.
就这样

449
00:35:04,140000 --> 00:35:05,603000
I don't know.
我不知道...

450
00:35:06,146000 --> 00:35:10,772000
She appears to be a well-intentioned, decent, intelligent girl.
听起来是个好姑娘  聪明  善良

451
00:35:10,940000 --> 00:35:13,612000
Clearly an idealist, bold and courageous.
理想  坚毅  勇敢

452
00:35:14,150000 --> 00:35:16,479000
Seems like she deserves some support.
也许应该帮助她

453
00:35:16,690000 --> 00:35:18,192000
What do you think?
不是吗

454
00:35:27,790000 --> 00:35:28,871000
Nihal?

455
00:35:32,380000 --> 00:35:33,874000
Frankly...
说实话...

456
00:35:35,800000 --> 00:35:38,125000
it didn't sound to me very...
我不觉得

457
00:35:38,300000 --> 00:35:40,841000
I get this every day from all over.
每天我都收到这样的邮件

458
00:35:41,890000 --> 00:35:42,886000
OK.
好

459
00:35:43,760000 --> 00:35:46,810000
What exactly didn't sound right to you?
那有没有什么具体的原因

460
00:35:47,060000 --> 00:35:48,224000
Well...
唔...

461
00:35:48,520000 --> 00:35:52,769000
Isn't it a bit of a luxury to build a new place just for this?
建楼房花费很高  不是吗

462
00:35:53,560000 --> 00:35:55,691000
It's a tiny village after all.
离建成还远...

463
00:35:55,860000 --> 00:35:59,445000
Normally the mukhtar gives a space for these things.
通常村长找一块地

464
00:35:59,610000 --> 00:36:03,150000
You decorate it a bit and you manage.

465
00:36:04,530000 --> 00:36:07,906000
So I felt it sounded a bit too much.
我觉得她要求太多

466
00:36:08,080000 --> 00:36:11,083000
Even the municipality refused to help them.
区政府也不帮忙

467
00:36:11,250000 --> 00:36:15,796000
We'll have a hard time finding common sense in municipal decisions.
按照逻辑来说  区政府...

468
00:36:20,170000 --> 00:36:22,088000
Well, I don't know.
我不知道

469
00:36:23,090000 --> 00:36:24,094000
And you, Suavi?
舒阿伟  你怎么看

470
00:36:24,970000 --> 00:36:26,350000
I really don't know.
我不知道该怎么看

471
00:36:27,390000 --> 00:36:31,261000
Don't you think you and I, and a few other local worthies
我们能不能聚集  你  我  还有其他有名望的人

472
00:36:31,430000 --> 00:36:33,231000
could get together?
来帮助他们

473
00:36:33,400000 --> 00:36:35,688000
Dear Aydin, do I really look like a worthy?
艾登  你觉得我有名望

474
00:36:35,819000 --> 00:36:39,816000
My belly is my only worthy feature, and it's now independent.
我也只有胃口值得注意  它还不听我使唤

475
00:36:41,360000 --> 00:36:42,240000
However,
总之...

476
00:36:44,950000 --> 00:36:47,410000
I must say you surprised me, Nihal.
你的回应令我吃惊  尼哈尔

477
00:36:48,080000 --> 00:36:49,370000
Why?
为什么

478
00:36:50,200000 --> 00:36:51,583000
Well...
因为...

479
00:36:52,120000 --> 00:36:57,121000
Because thanks to you this hotel has been run like a charity for years.
多亏了你  这里看起来更像是慈善机构  而不是旅店

480
00:36:57,880000 --> 00:36:59,922000
What are you trying to say?
你是什么意思

481
00:37:00,090000 --> 00:37:01,172000
Well...
唔...

482
00:37:02,760000 --> 00:37:04,636000
When a chronic philanthropist,
做慈善是你的专利

483
00:37:04,800000 --> 00:37:08,140000
who has helped almost every school in the area,
你帮助过这里最小的小学

484
00:37:08,309000 --> 00:37:12,521000
opposes this idea so firmly, I fail to understand.
但却如此坚决地拒绝这样的请求 我不明白

485
00:37:12,770000 --> 00:37:14,563000
What is there to understand?
简单来说

486
00:37:14,850000 --> 00:37:16,934000
It's a matter of urgency.
要分先后

487
00:37:17,110000 --> 00:37:21,060000
There are primary schools with leaky roofs and rotten windows.
屋顶漏雨窗子破烂的学校  要首先帮助

488
00:37:21,230000 --> 00:37:24,156000
Little kids studying with their gloves on.
孩子们上课还要戴手套的

489
00:37:24,320000 --> 00:37:27,659000
Isn't it more logical to solve these problems first?
我觉得先帮助他们没错吧

490
00:37:28,740000 --> 00:37:32,580000
We've been collecting donations for this for a long time now.
我们花费几个月筹募资金

491
00:37:32,910000 --> 00:37:35,539000
But it never attracted your attention.
但你从不感兴趣

492
00:37:35,710000 --> 00:37:39,211000
So I don't understand your sudden charity.
而现在你突然如此慷慨

493
00:37:42,340000 --> 00:37:45,428000
Anyway, I'm expecting guests. I have to go.
好吧  我期待太多了  我走了

494
00:37:45,840000 --> 00:37:50,260000
Mr Suavi, could you come and see me for a minute before you leave?
舒阿伟  在你走之前再见我一面

495
00:37:50,430000 --> 00:37:51,811000
Sure. I'll drop by.
好啊

496
00:37:51,936000 --> 00:37:55,056000
Then I won't say goodbye. See you shortly.
那我先不说再见了

497
00:38:11,990000 --> 00:38:13,991000
You know what?
你知道我怎么想吗

498
00:38:15,620000 --> 00:38:19,458000
All this poverty and hardship is like a natural disaster.
苦痛  贫穷  都是自然灾难

499
00:38:20,630000 --> 00:38:23,039000
In a sense, it's the will of God.
上天做主

500
00:38:23,840000 --> 00:38:26,168000
You can't oppose destiny.
我们没法反抗命运

501
00:38:26,720000 --> 00:38:30,422000
But God also gave us intelligence to fight such things.
但上天也赋予我们智慧  让我们解决问题

502
00:38:31,220000 --> 00:38:32,341000
That's true.
没错

503
00:38:33,390000 --> 00:38:35,138000
That's true, however...
没错  但是

504
00:38:36,690000 --> 00:38:40,474000
there are people specially created for such tasks.

505
00:38:40,650000 --> 00:38:43,439000
You should leave these tasks to them.
要让他们完成他们的工作

506
00:38:43,610000 --> 00:38:46,400000
You're a creative man. You are an artist.

507
00:38:46,570000 --> 00:38:49,113000
Why bother yourself with such things?
这件事与你何干呢

508
00:38:49,990000 --> 00:38:52,071000
Stick to your own work.
做好你的工作就行了

509
00:38:57,870000 --> 00:38:59,585000
Mr Aydin, Hamdi is here.

-哪个哈姆迪  -哈姆迪  霍加  租户

511

512
00:39:05,460000 --> 00:39:07,010000

You could've kept your shoes on. It's not that clean.
不用脱鞋  这里没那么干净

520
00:40:05,610000 --> 00:40:09,479000
No, Mr Aydin. My shoes got muddy. It's better like this.
都沾上泥了  还是放外头吧

-我给你拿拖鞋  -没事的

Hold on. The floor is very cold in here.
等一下  地上凉

实际上  艾登先生  我不知从何说起

528
00:40:45,860000 --> 00:40:49,567000
When you came the other day, it was a bit...

Sorry, just a minute.

00:40:50,990000 --> 00:40:54,116000
It's a bit stuffy in here. If you don't mind...

Honestly, I don't know how to put it.

It was embarrassing for us, I'm sorry, but...
很尴尬  我们很抱歉  真的

535
00:41:10,630000 --> 00:41:12,758000
we didn't mean badly, of course.

But have you asked him why he did it?

could have had quite serious consequences.

Yes, of course, I asked him.

And what did he say?

544
00:41:38,370000 --> 00:41:40,780000
Well, Mr Aydin...

545
00:41:40,870000 --> 00:41:43,413000
the kid was upset by the debt collector,
他那时候被抓起来了

546
00:41:43,500000 --> 00:41:46,289000
so he went and did such a stupid thing.

547
00:41:46,370000 --> 00:41:49,666000
Especially seeing his father get beaten up.

548
00:41:49,750000 --> 00:41:51,465000

When the debt collectors came,

550
00:41:55,220000 --> 00:41:59,005000
Ismail tried to stop them obviously.

And the police were there.

553
00:42:04,020000 --> 00:42:06,144000
I see.
我懂了

554
00:42:07,730000 --> 00:42:11,482000
So our car paid the price, right?
所以  我们的车就这样了  对吧

00:42:11,570000 --> 00:42:14,857000
More or less, Mr Aydin. I apologize.

But now the boy feels really bad about it.

558
00:42:22,200000 --> 00:42:23,998000
No. No need for that.

00:42:24,080000 --> 00:42:26,872000
He regrets it. Really.
真的有必要

560
00:42:27,170000 --> 00:42:31,588000
But as I said the other day, we always pay our debts.

I actually have some money now.

So I came to pay for the car window.

563
00:42:37,470000 --> 00:42:39,382000
How much was it?

564
00:42:39,470000 --> 00:42:42,392000
It doesn't matter.
这不重要

565
00:42:43,010000 --> 00:42:47,563000
Sort it out with Hidayet. I don't know much about it.
你可以和陶菲克讲 我不知道

I think it was 70 liras or something.

But it's best you talk with Hidayet.

70 liras?

70 liras for just one window?

570
00:43:00,160000 --> 00:43:01,525000
That's right.
是啊

571
00:43:02,200000 --> 00:43:05,538000
And it is not the brand-name one. If it had been...
而且还不是原本的牌子了

572
00:43:06,000000 --> 00:43:08,918000
Hidayet can show you the bill.
希达可以给你看发票

573
00:43:09,870000 --> 00:43:11,208000

I'm not sure if I have enough on me.

Let me just ask Hidayet how much it was.

It's no big deal. There's no rush.

577
00:43:22,260000 --> 00:43:26,850000
After all, it's just a window.

00:43:28,060000 --> 00:43:29,393000
You think so?

00:43:29,850000 --> 00:43:33,061000
In that case, I'd better not pay in installments.
这样的话  我就不硬撑了

580
00:43:33,150000 --> 00:43:35,905000
I'll pay it all in one go, then.
我回头一起付清

581
00:43:35,980000 --> 00:43:38,070000
Just to prevent any confusion.

You there?

I got it wrong then. OK, alright.

Fine, no problem. Never mind.

我记错了  不是70块  是170块钱

Hidayet can show you the bill.

I forgot to ask if he took a bill though.

595
00:44:21,780000 --> 00:44:23,610000
That's strange.

There must be some mistake, surely.
一定有什么出错了  艾登先生

What's this? Are there no men's slippers?

Fatma had these at home.
法蒂玛就拿回家了

00:44:50,640000 --> 00:44:52,604000
Where shall I put the tea?

Here. Let me move this.

Now, Hamdi, listen...

I've got various houses and shops in town.

Not just mine actually...

610
00:45:36,310000 --> 00:45:39,353000
They're my sister Necla's too.

611
00:45:39,520000 --> 00:45:42,731000
If I tried to look after them all myself,

I'd have no time to work on my book and articles.
我就没法写书写文章了

613
00:45:47,490000 --> 00:45:48,989000
See what I mean?
你明白吗

614
00:45:49,200000 --> 00:45:54,709000
So I let Hidayet and the lawyers deal with the rent and lawsuits.
所以陶菲克和律师们才吓唬你要为了房租上法庭

615
00:45:56,330000 --> 00:45:58,880000
I often don't even know what they're doing.

616
00:45:59,090000 --> 00:46:01,545000
And if they tell me, I tend to forget.

617
00:46:02,300000 --> 00:46:05,468000
The other day, your younger or older brother...

00:46:12,437000 --> 00:46:13,930000
not to mention the debt collectors.
别说抓人的事情了

622
00:46:14,600000 --> 00:46:18,437000
I wasn't even aware you were my tenants.

623
00:46:19,150000 --> 00:46:23,896000
When the rent is not paid, lawyers do these things automatically.
这些程序是没缴清房租时自然发生的事

624
00:46:24,820000 --> 00:46:25,860000
Understand?
你明白吗

625
00:46:26,200000 --> 00:46:28,987000
Of course, Mr Aydin. It's obvious.
是啊  艾登先生  您不用说明

626
00:46:29,120000 --> 00:46:31,326000
You have to do these things.
您没办法才这样做的

627
00:46:31,490000 --> 00:46:34,498000
You've been very patient with us.
您已经很宽宏大量了

628
00:46:34,660000 --> 00:46:38,249000
But, since Ismail came out of prison,

629
00:46:38,420000 --> 00:46:40,746000
he hasn't sorted himself out yet.
他还没有恢复

630
00:46:40,920000 --> 00:46:42,750000
Nobody gives him a job.
他没有工作

631
00:46:42,920000 --> 00:46:46,010000
I don't see why not, but they don't.
我不知道为什么  但事实如此

632
00:46:46,470000 --> 00:46:50,420000
That's why we need time to get back on our feet.
我们需要时间才能还钱

633
00:46:50,890000 --> 00:46:54,724000
So, Mr Aydin, if you could just step in

634
00:46:54,930000 --> 00:46:57,891000
to stop the eviction...

We will sort something out as soon as possible.

636
00:47:01,610000 --> 00:47:03,604000
We really don't want to lose the house.
我一辈子都在这房子里了

637
00:47:03,770000 --> 00:47:07,065000
I spent my entire childhood in that house.
整个童年都是在这里度过的

638
00:47:07,610000 --> 00:47:09,786000
So if you could give us more time...
如果你能给我们一点点时间...

639
00:47:09,786000 --> 00:47:12,193000
What do you expect me to say?

640
00:47:12,370000 --> 00:47:14,364000
I see your point but...

you need to discuss it with Hidayet.

I don't know anything about it.

643
00:47:22,630000 --> 00:47:23,880000
Did you talk to him?

00:47:24,250000 --> 00:47:26,084000
- No. - Talk to Hidayet.
-没有-和他谈谈

645
00:47:26,469000 --> 00:47:27,800000
I mean...
明白吗

646
00:47:27,970000 --> 00:47:31,754000
There's Hidayet and the lawyers. You don't need to come to me.
你不该来见我  你该去见希达和律师们

647
00:47:31,970000 --> 00:47:34,263000
They know more about it.
他们才知道事情经过

648
00:47:35,850000 --> 00:47:38,391000
Don't come to me again.
不要来找我

649
00:47:39,060000 --> 00:47:42,185000
I don't want to mislead you.

650
00:47:47,110000 --> 00:47:50,318000
In a country with a 99% Muslim population,

who are cultivated, neat,

653
00:47:55,870000 --> 00:48:00,001000
whose very presence is reassuring?
"难道不该是这样令人舒心的形象吗

654
00:48:01,500000 --> 00:48:04,671000
The weekly sermon prepared by our imams,
"每周教长布道

655
00:48:04,840000 --> 00:48:08,624000
from their reading,
"他们的诵读

656
00:48:08,800000 --> 00:48:11,804000
will be heard with pleasure and admiration
"信徒愉快而敬佩地接受

and will elevate the people.

Islam is a religion of civilization and high culture.

It's not too harsh?

00:48:31,740000 --> 00:48:32,700000
No.

No.
没有

665
00:48:37,373000 --> 00:48:40,409000
You don't say anything about religion itself.
你没有直接谈宗教信仰

666
00:48:40,830000 --> 00:48:44,790000
You talk about the practices of those who apply it.
你说的是那些信徒怎样做的

667
00:48:45,130000 --> 00:48:48,546000
And I also say Islam is a religion of high culture.
而且最后我说伊斯兰教是有着高度文化的宗教

668
00:48:48,710000 --> 00:48:50,093000

I don't really care for these things.

But you know it's delicate.
但这是个敏感话题

671
00:49:00,100000 --> 00:49:04,054000
But the guy annoys me so much, I can't stop myself writing.
让我很激动  没法不去写

672
00:49:04,730000 --> 00:49:08,019000
So he managed to become the subject of an article.
实际上  这是我文章的主题

673
00:49:08,270000 --> 00:49:12,822000
With his shabbiness, slyness, vagueness...
当下风气腐坏  不能光明正大的描述问题

674
00:49:13,280000 --> 00:49:14,565000
You know...
是吧

675
00:49:17,620000 --> 00:49:21,571000
I once played an imam in a play and got good reviews.
有一次我做教长  反响不错

676
00:49:21,750000 --> 00:49:25,700000
Now when I see him, I tend to think I wasn't that good.
然后有一次  我看见了这个人  我觉得一切都错了

677

Right?

That's the biggest danger.

Ilyas? Isn't that right, my dear?

I don't like getting my hand kissed.

他们抢着来亲他的手  是吧  内吉纳

01:07:00,100000 --> 01:07:03,641000
I don't know what to do with the new maid, Nihal.
我不知道该拿她怎么办好

948
01:07:03,770000 --> 01:07:06,433000
She put glasses I love in the dishwasher.
她把我喜欢的杯子放进了洗碗机里

949
01:07:06,600000 --> 01:07:07,982000
Two got smashed.
两个都碎了

950
01:07:08,100000 --> 01:07:09,600000
I know, she told me.
她和我说了

951
01:07:09,770000 --> 01:07:14,652000
They're obviously too thin for the dishwasher. They broke.
杯子很薄的  很明显不能放进洗碗机

952
01:07:14,940000 --> 01:07:18,198000
I'm thinking of taking it out of her wages to teach her.
也许她要赔钱才明白不能这么干

953
01:07:18,360000 --> 01:07:20,609000
That's a bit much. Forget it.
别夸张  忘了吧

954
01:07:20,780000 --> 01:07:25,116000
I'm not exaggerating. There are things you love and value.
我没夸张 我们也有想要的东西啊

955
01:07:25,580000 --> 01:07:28,952000
I bought them in Istanbul. You can't get them anymore.
那两个是在伊斯坦布尔买的  再也买不到了

956
01:07:29,120000 --> 01:07:32,794000
I know, but they're just glasses.
我明白 但只是两个杯子啊

957
01:07:35,300000 --> 01:07:37,875000
Maybe you're right. I don't know.
你也许是对的  我不知道

958
01:07:44,640000 --> 01:07:46,850000
No, maybe you're right.
你也许有道理

959
01:07:48,730000 --> 01:07:52,563000
I'm aware I'm a bit nervy lately.
这些日子我很容易生气

960
01:07:55,900000 --> 01:07:57,316000
It's because I worry too much.
忧心忡忡

961
01:07:58,240000 --> 01:08:00,068000
Worry about what?
为什么

962
01:08:00,360000 --> 01:08:03,037000
There's so much going around in my head.
脑子里事情太多

963
01:08:05,200000 --> 01:08:08,041000
My ex has become a real alcoholic.
我前夫是个酒鬼

964
01:08:08,540000 --> 01:08:10,701000
- Who? Necdet? - Yes.
-谁  内杰代特  -嗯

965
01:08:11,040000 --> 01:08:13,797000
But he always drank a lot, didn't he?
事情总有好的一面  不是吗

966
01:08:14,290000 --> 01:08:16,090000
He did indeed, but...
没错

967
01:08:17,090000 --> 01:08:20,426000
he's been drinking much more since we separated.
但自从离婚  他喝得就更多了

968
01:08:21,130000 --> 01:08:23,511000
He starts the minute he gets up.
从早上就开始喝

969
01:08:26,470000 --> 01:08:28,885000
But there's nothing you can do about that.
管不住的

970
01:08:29,390000 --> 01:08:30,773000
I know...
我知道

971
01:08:30,940000 --> 01:08:32,684000
but sometimes...
但有时候

972
01:08:33,480000 --> 01:08:37,399000
I can't help thinking we're worse off after splitting up.
我在想  离婚是不是把事情越变越糟

973
01:08:37,900000 --> 01:08:41,773000
Him over there in that state, me here miserable.
他那个样子  我也不开心

974
01:08:41,950000 --> 01:08:44,870000
- Is that what you really think? - Well...
-你真的这么想  -唔...

975
01:08:47,540000 --> 01:08:51,289000
Maybe I'm just trying to figure out where I went wrong.
我在想是从什么时候

976
01:08:51,750000 --> 01:08:53,627000
What I did that made us end up like this.
为什么  变成了这样

977
01:08:53,790000 --> 01:08:55,836000
But if you've still found nothing
如果你想不明白

978
01:08:56,250000 --> 01:08:58,831000
years later, maybe it's not your fault at all.
说明也许错不在你

979
01:08:59,670000 --> 01:09:01,006000
Don't you agree?
你这么想吗

980
01:09:01,340000 --> 01:09:03,173000
You want me to join the herd
你想让我相信

981
01:09:03,340000 --> 01:09:07,048000
that believes all badness comes from others?
邪恶总是从别人身上而来吗

982
01:09:07,220000 --> 01:09:07,973000
No.
不是

983
01:09:08,180000 --> 01:09:11,312000
But it still doesn't have to be "your" mistake.
但你也不一定有错

984
01:09:11,480000 --> 01:09:12,975000
That's what I'm saying.
我是这个意思

985
01:09:13,190000 --> 01:09:15,978000
Why do you never want to think like that?
为什么

986
01:09:16,360000 --> 01:09:19,231000
Because I don't see any good in it.
因为我不感兴趣

987
01:09:19,650000 --> 01:09:24,447000
A sensible person should only be interested in her own share of guilt.
一位敏感的人该觉得这与自己有关

988
01:09:24,610000 --> 01:09:28,699000
I see no harm in some self-deception to protect yourself.
盲目一点没什么不好

989
01:09:28,870000 --> 01:09:30,913000
But, well...
但是如果你如此坚持

990
01:09:32,160000 --> 01:09:34,375000
Where do you think you're wrong?
你如何欺骗他了

991
01:09:34,540000 --> 01:09:36,585000
I don't know but...
我不知道

992
01:09:37,340000 --> 01:09:39,463000
I'm just saying it as an example...
我在想  比如说

993
01:09:39,920000 --> 01:09:45,798000
If I'd overlooked all the evil stuff Necdet did to me,
如果我忽视他对我造成的所有伤害

994
01:09:48,850000 --> 01:09:51,058000
if I hadn't resisted,
如果不反抗

995
01:09:52,230000 --> 01:09:54,637000
if I hadn't divorced him, say.
比如说  不离婚

996
01:09:57,520000 --> 01:10:01,441000
If I could have made him face his own evil side.
我就不必面对错误

997
01:10:01,989000 --> 01:10:03,234000
I don't know.
我不知道

998
01:10:03,860000 --> 01:10:08,160000
I wonder what would've happened if I had acted differently.
如果我不这样做  会怎样呢

999
01:10:08,320000 --> 01:10:13,084000
You mean, if you hadn't resisted all the bad things he did,
你在想  如果你不反抗邪恶

1000
01:10:13,084000 --> 01:10:16,087000
he would've finally felt ashamed?
后悔的就不是你  而是他

1001
01:10:16,087000 --> 01:10:20,666000
Yes. Yes. Exactly. You put it well.
对  我就是这么想的

1002
01:10:22,420000 --> 01:10:25,844000
I know it sounds absurd, but it isn't, believe me.
虽然听起来很荒谬  但也许就是这样

1003
01:10:25,930000 --> 01:10:30,135000
Sorry, Necla, but I find it hard to believe.
对不起  内吉纳  但这毫无道理

1004
01:10:30,260000 --> 01:10:33,851000
People don't change that much after a certain age.
我相信  过了一定年龄  人就不会变了

1005
01:10:33,930000 --> 01:10:38,233000
On the contrary, all their bad habits get even worse.
相反  只有坏习惯不会变

1006
01:10:38,860000 --> 01:10:41,613000
So remaining silent in the face of evil
如果不与邪恶抗争

1007
01:10:41,730000 --> 01:10:47,030000
does nothing but make the other feel even more justified.
只会让他的所作所为变得更糟糕

1008
01:10:47,200000 --> 01:10:49,324000
I think he regrets it now, too.
我想他现在后悔了

1009
01:10:50,910000 --> 01:10:52,538000
That's why I say this.
所以我才这样说

1010
01:10:52,700000 --> 01:10:54,415000
I feel it.
我感觉得到

1011
01:10:55,870000 --> 01:10:59,708000
If he could find an excuse, he'd come here right away.
他如果来找我  还会有机会

1012
01:10:59,880000 --> 01:11:04,341000
If I were living somewhere else, he'd definitely do that.
如果我住在别处  他可能早就来了

1013
01:11:06,550000 --> 01:11:08,593000
But after all that happened,
但是发生这么多事以后

1014
01:11:09,930000 --> 01:11:12,257000
he is a bit scared of Aydin now.
他有点怕艾登

1015
01:11:15,770000 --> 01:11:18,393000
But you know what I sometimes feel like?
你知道有时候我会想什么吗

1016
01:11:22,190000 --> 01:11:23,939000
Going and asking him for forgiveness.
去请求他原谅

1017
01:11:25,650000 --> 01:11:26,819000
Necdet?
请求内杰代特原谅

1018
01:11:27,990000 --> 01:11:29,023000
Yes.
对

1019
01:11:31,740000 --> 01:11:33,537000
But you did nothing wrong.
但你并没有错

1020
01:11:33,700000 --> 01:11:35,165000
Precisely.
是啊

1021
01:11:35,620000 --> 01:11:38,199000
In fact, that's the beauty of it.
这才是整件事的美感

1022
01:11:38,870000 --> 01:11:41,167000
Making the other really ashamed.
让我来尴尬

1023
01:11:41,920000 --> 01:11:45,126000
And in this way, maybe bringing out the good in him.
成就最好的他

1024
01:11:51,010000 --> 01:11:54,965000
Necla, have you been watching too many soap operas recently?
你最近是不是肥皂剧看多了

1025
01:11:56,600000 --> 01:11:57,884000
What do you mean?
为什么这么说

1026
01:11:58,390000 --> 01:12:00,355000
Such things only happen there.
只有看了肥皂剧才会这么想

1027
01:12:02,860000 --> 01:12:04,937000
There's nothing to say.
没什么好说的

1028
01:12:05,440000 --> 01:12:06,822000
It's your decision.
你自己做决定

1029
01:12:07,190000 --> 01:12:09,321000
I think it's utter nonsense,
我觉得很荒唐

1030
01:12:09,490000 --> 01:12:14,035000
but if that's what you want to do nobody is going to stop you.
但如果你想去  没人拦得了你

1031
01:12:14,490000 --> 01:12:16,039000
You can do what you like.
想做就做吧

1032
01:12:17,410000 --> 01:12:20,620000
But then, you're the one who has to face the consequences.
但是想想后果

1033
01:12:21,120000 --> 01:12:22,753000
Keep that in mind, too.
别忘了

1034
01:12:23,750000 --> 01:12:25,002000
That's how I see it.
我是这么想的

1035
01:12:39,810000 --> 01:12:43,349000
Those petty, multiple-meaning, sarcastic words,
这些小表情  充满讽刺  模糊不定

1036
01:12:45,020000 --> 01:12:47,945000
and those little, cynical lip movements.
嘴唇的小动作  冷嘲热讽

1037
01:12:48,940000 --> 01:12:52,234000
I realize now how sick I am of it, how much I hate it.
我受够了  我不喜欢

1038
01:12:53,610000 --> 01:12:55,945000
Necla, you're going too far. Please.
内吉纳  别扯远了

1039
01:12:56,120000 --> 01:12:58,161000
The real reason I'd apologize to Necdet
基本上  如果我去请求内杰代特原谅我

1040
01:12:58,330000 --> 01:13:01,749000
is maybe to get away from all of you and all of this.
我就可以甩掉你了

1041
01:13:01,910000 --> 01:13:03,876000
It's pretty clear now.
我可以想得到

1042
01:13:05,210000 --> 01:13:08,334000
Nobody is going to stop me? Of course not.
没人拦我  谢天谢地

1043
01:13:08,920000 --> 01:13:11,334000
I don't need anybody's permission for that.
我又不需要人批准

1044
01:13:11,920000 --> 01:13:14,254000
This is my father's house too.
这是我爸爸的地方

1045
01:13:14,430000 --> 01:13:16,639000
I'll stay or go as I please.
我来去自如

1046
01:13:19,060000 --> 01:13:20,224000
Besides...
还有

1047
01:13:20,850000 --> 01:13:25,433000
I've already paid the price for telling the truth to your face.
听你说你的四字箴言  我受的伤害就够大了

1048
01:13:26,770000 --> 01:13:29,020000
A price none of you has paid.
我还是唯一一个

1049
01:13:41,790000 --> 01:13:42,990000
Isn't that
看

1050
01:13:43,160000 --> 01:13:44,083000
Omar Sharif?
奥马尔·谢里夫

1051
01:13:44,250000 --> 01:13:45,451000
What?
嗯

1052
01:13:47,040000 --> 01:13:48,791000
The photo. It's Omar Sharif?
照片上是奥马尔·谢里夫吗

1053
01:13:48,960000 --> 01:13:51,801000
Yes. They shot a movie here.
是  他在这拍过电影

1054
01:13:51,960000 --> 01:13:53,084000
At this hotel?
在旅馆里

1055
01:13:53,260000 --> 01:13:55,089000
No, I mean in this area.
不是  在角落那边

1056
01:13:55,380000 --> 01:13:57,429000
He's such a humble man.
这人心地单纯

1057
01:13:57,600000 --> 01:13:59,722000
He'd take a picture with anybody.
肯跟所有人合照

1058
01:13:59,930000 --> 01:14:01,181000
- Really? - Yes.
-真的  -嗯

1059
01:14:01,350000 --> 01:14:03,845000
You don't expect that of a big star.
我们都不相信他是个大明星

1060
01:14:04,020000 --> 01:14:05,269000
But he's not like that.
不是那样的

1061
01:14:05,440000 --> 01:14:07,350000
What film was it?
电影怎样

1062
01:14:07,980000 --> 01:14:10,821000
I can't remember. I don't want to mislead you.

1063
01:14:11,320000 --> 01:14:12,603000
Hello.

艾登先生  奥马尔·谢里夫在这拍了什么

-"亚伯拉罕先生"  -那部"亚伯拉罕"啊

1066
01:14:21,040000 --> 01:14:24,622000
I've heard about it. Where exactly did they shoot it?
我想起来点什么  他们后来去了哪

1067
01:14:25,290000 --> 01:14:27,749000
Around here. In Ishtar and other places.
就这附近  其中有伊什塔尔

1068
01:14:27,880000 --> 01:14:29,339000
- Ishtar? - Yes.
-伊什塔尔  -嗯

1069
01:14:29,500000 --> 01:14:30,882000
Interesting.
有意思

1070
01:14:31,008000 --> 01:14:33,001000
Let's see where it is.
我要去看看

1071
01:14:36,430000 --> 01:14:37,841000
Where is everybody?
其他人呢

1072
01:14:39,220000 --> 01:14:43,305000
You mean Mrs Nihal and Necla? They were here a minute ago.
我是说尼哈尔和内吉纳  早些时候她们还在的

1073
01:14:44,270000 --> 01:14:45,470000
Doing what?
她们在干嘛

1074
01:14:45,607000 --> 01:14:47,017000
Talking.
她们聊天呢

1075
01:14:47,770000 --> 01:14:49,649000
Here, in the lobby.
在门口呢

1076
01:14:49,777000 --> 01:14:50,524000
Really?
哦...

1077
01:14:50,650000 --> 01:14:53,571000
I went out and when I came back, they'd left.
我刚来一分钟她们就走了

1078
01:14:54,360000 --> 01:14:56,025000
Were they talking normally?
她们聊得正常吗

1079
01:14:56,990000 --> 01:14:58,985000
What do you mean "normally"?
怎么算正常

1080
01:15:01,330000 --> 01:15:02,575000
Whatever.

to make his paper look influential.

and an amateur's.

No, I don't think so.

I don't know. Should she?

01:22:56,720000 --> 01:22:57,884000
I believe she does.
有可能

She's an expert at criticizing by remaining silent.

1218
01:23:14,740000 --> 01:23:16,068000
About what?
就是说

1219
01:23:17,150000 --> 01:23:18,439000
I mean...
唔...

1220
01:23:19,030000 --> 01:23:23,496000
Pontificating in a column on matters I don't know much about.
对于我不了解的事情大说特说

1221
01:23:23,830000 --> 01:23:25,410000
Pontificating?
大说特说

1222
01:23:27,040000 --> 01:23:29,749000
I see you found my articles worse than I thought.
比我想得要严肃多了

1223
01:23:29,920000 --> 01:23:33,337000
No. I'm not saying they're bad...
我不是说这样不好

1224
01:23:34,260000 --> 01:23:36,133000
It's something else.
是别的什么

1225
01:23:36,300000 --> 01:23:37,549000
Something else?
别的什么

1226
01:23:37,720000 --> 01:23:39,714000
Like what?
是什么

1227

I mean, they're like...

1228
01:23:43,970000 --> 01:23:46,433000
Mediocre? Bloodless?

01:23:46,600000 --> 01:23:48,432000
I can't find the right term.
我找不到合适的词

1230
01:23:48,600000 --> 01:23:50,018000
Harmless.

1231
01:23:50,940000 --> 01:23:52,900000
Is that what you mean?
你是不是这个意思

1232
01:23:53,360000 --> 01:23:55,188000
I don't know. Maybe.
我不知道  也许吧

1233
01:23:58,650000 --> 01:24:00,984000
Your words are sweeter than honey today.
你今天挺宽厚啊

1234
01:24:01,740000 --> 01:24:03,903000
I'm trying to be realistic.
我只是想现实一点

1235
01:24:04,330000 --> 01:24:06,323000
Well, bravo, what else can I say?
很好  太好了

1236
01:24:07,080000 --> 01:24:09,575000
If you want, I can stop being realistic.
但我也可以不那么现实

1237
01:24:12,750000 --> 01:24:16,042000
Too late. The genie is out of the bottle.
太晚了  精灵都从神灯里跑出来了

1238
01:24:17,460000 --> 01:24:19,545000
Well, if you ask for opinions
你该知道的

1239
01:24:19,720000 --> 01:24:22,213000
you have to face the consequences.
你问我意见  我给你回答

1240
01:24:22,390000 --> 01:24:24,882000
What can I say? That's true.
没错

1241
01:24:32,520000 --> 01:24:34,815000
In the old days, we admired you.
之前我们很仰慕你

1242
01:24:38,150000 --> 01:24:39,948000
We thought
我们相信

1243
01:24:40,110000 --> 01:24:43,367000
you'd do great things, become quite famous even.
你生来就能做大事

1244
01:24:45,490000 --> 01:24:47,241000
But it didn't happen.
结果不是这样

1245
01:24:50,080000 --> 01:24:52,374000
The elephant gave birth to a mouse.

1246
01:24:54,710000 --> 01:24:57,004000
Sorry to disappoint you.
不好意思  扫兴了

1247
01:24:57,170000 --> 01:24:59,583000
That's obviously not your fault.
你无事可做

1248
01:25:01,130000 --> 01:25:03,464000
It's us who set the bar so high.
我们把门槛设得太高了

1249
01:25:03,640000 --> 01:25:06,595000
So I should feel comforted.
挺好  听来安心多了

1250
01:25:08,310000 --> 01:25:10,719000
What about "Flowers of the Steppes"?
对了"草原野花"

1251
01:25:11,350000 --> 01:25:12,387000
What did you think of it?
你怎么看

1252
01:25:12,560000 --> 01:25:14,357000
To be honest,
那篇文章

1253
01:25:14,520000 --> 01:25:18,311000
that's the article that actually made me think like this.
正是令我大开眼界的文章

1254
01:25:21,450000 --> 01:25:22,860000
Really? In what way?
说说吧

1255
01:25:23,410000 --> 01:25:26,826000
How can I put it? This soppy romanticism.
怎么说得出来呢  这份甜腻的浪漫

1256
01:25:26,990000 --> 01:25:31,160000
This naïve, unconvincing self-belief.
天真的自欺欺人

1257
01:25:31,830000 --> 01:25:33,330000
Takes no risks, for one thing.
几乎没有...丝毫没有冒险精神

1258
01:25:34,500000 --> 01:25:36,498000
It looks like the writer
作者只是

1259
01:25:37,210000 --> 01:25:40,549000
adopts positive values accepted by all,
图省事

1260
01:25:40,710000 --> 01:25:42,677000
just to endear himself.
老生常谈

1261
01:25:43,510000 --> 01:25:45,756000
Sometimes the disguise of lyricism
抒情的句式

1262
01:25:45,930000 --> 01:25:49,349000
makes it stink of sentimentality.
丑恶的自作多情

1263
01:25:51,310000 --> 01:25:53,769000
You really are annoyed.
我懂了  你觉得难以忍受

1264
01:25:53,940000 --> 01:25:56,480000
I must confess I don't like this style much.
我只是说  我不喜欢这个风格

1265
01:25:56,730000 --> 01:26:00,234000
If what you say is true, I should just quit writing.
听了你的花  我不该写作了

1266
01:26:01,280000 --> 01:26:04,152000
No, dear. This is just my point of view.
别啊  这只是我的看法

1267
01:26:04,320000 --> 01:26:07,909000
Luckily not everybody thinks like you.
幸好别人不这么看

1268
01:26:08,780000 --> 01:26:10,449000
Naturally.
当然

1269
01:26:14,040000 --> 01:26:15,455000
Who are they?
别人是谁

1270
01:26:17,170000 --> 01:26:18,880000
I see you're curious.
你挺感兴趣啊

1271
01:26:19,290000 --> 01:26:21,873000
No. It's just because you mentioned it.
不  只是因为你提到了

1272
01:26:23,550000 --> 01:26:26,673000
- I haven't offended you, have I? - Not at all.
-我没惹你生气吧  -一点也没有

1273
01:26:27,590000 --> 01:26:28,927000
Are you sure?
你确定

1274
01:26:33,020000 --> 01:26:34,397000
Maybe a little.
只有一点点

1275
01:26:35,310000 --> 01:26:39,183000
A writer can be very sensitive regarding his work.
有些时候作者对他们的作品很敏感

1276
01:26:39,730000 --> 01:26:41,895000
But don't worry, I can handle it.
但我会没事的  别担心

1277
01:26:42,070000 --> 01:26:46,366000
But dear, you're not coming up with coherent, constructive criticism.
问题是你不把话说清楚

1278
01:26:46,530000 --> 01:26:49,987000
Like your remarks are always hiding something.
你总是含沙射影

1279
01:26:50,160000 --> 01:26:51,788000
That's what's annoying.
很气人

1280
01:26:51,950000 --> 01:26:57,296000
So I get to thinking it's me you hate, not the articles.
我觉得你可能讨厌的是我  不是我的文章

1281
01:26:57,460000 --> 01:26:58,411000
That's absurd.
太荒唐了

1282
01:26:58,580000 --> 01:27:00,213000
But that's the case.
但这是事实

1283
01:27:00,500000 --> 01:27:02,800000
And of course, we've become very different now.
我们截然不同

1284
01:27:03,260000 --> 01:27:04,635000
We must accept that.
必须认清这一点

1285
01:27:04,800000 --> 01:27:07,674000
We see things, life itself, quite differently.
生活中所有事情  我们意见都不一致

1286
01:27:08,300000 --> 01:27:11,343000
That's probably natural.
我们本质就不同

1287
01:27:11,510000 --> 01:27:15,219000
The older you get, the more particular, rigid you get.
越老脾气越硬

1288
01:27:16,140000 --> 01:27:19,731000
After a while, it seems normal you don't like them.
所以你不喜欢我的文章很自然

1289
01:27:20,730000 --> 01:27:22,693000
That's maybe how it should be.
要不是这样才让人吃惊呢

1290
01:27:22,860000 --> 01:27:26,991000
In fact, this might even be something I should be pleased about.
我应该欢呼才是

1291
01:27:27,150000 --> 01:27:27,990000
You see?
你明白吗

1292
01:27:28,240000 --> 01:27:29,654000
Anyway...
好吧...

1293
01:27:29,820000 --> 01:27:32,663000
I don't want to go into it any further.
我不想再谈这么话题了

1294
01:27:36,580000 --> 01:27:40,879000
It's incredible how you always float to the surface like olive oil.
你结束话题的方式真令人惊讶 就好像看了竖趾旋转一样

1295
01:27:41,590000 --> 01:27:44,460000
You find a way to justify yourself, as usual.
总是用这么好的词为自己辩护呢

1296
01:27:44,630000 --> 01:27:47,007000
Necla, please, can we drop it?
别说了  行吗

1297
01:27:47,170000 --> 01:27:50,299000
You wanted to ask me something when you came in.
你可以问个问题

1298
01:27:50,760000 --> 01:27:51,761000
It's done.
不问了

1299
01:27:51,930000 --> 01:27:54,305000
No. What were you going to ask?
你想知道什么

1300
01:27:55,470000 --> 01:27:59,062000
The subject of the article you've just sent.
你刚发出去的文章题目

1301
01:27:59,230000 --> 01:28:00,976000
No, it wasn't that.
我不信

1302
01:28:01,560000 --> 01:28:03,110000
Yes, that's what it was.
假设那是我的问题

1303
01:28:03,270000 --> 01:28:07,987000
OK. Religion, morals, this and that. Nothing of your interest.
谈了信仰和道德  哪个你都不感兴趣

1304
01:28:08,150000 --> 01:28:09,818000
Now I see.
我懂了

1305
01:28:10,577000 --> 01:28:14,195000
You found a victim and you're making the most of it.
你可算找到你的替罪羊了  你要好好榨干这人

1306
01:28:14,370000 --> 01:28:16,080000
Stop harassing the poor man.
愿这个可怜的家伙安息

1307
01:28:16,240000 --> 01:28:17,910000
Necla, I'm losing my temper.
内吉纳  你开始烦人了

1308
01:28:18,080000 --> 01:28:19,460000
What does it have to do with it?
你为什么这么说

1309
01:28:19,620000 --> 01:28:23,329000
I should ask what religion, faith, spirituality have to do with you.
关于宗教  信仰  精神  你懂些什么

1310
01:28:23,920000 --> 01:28:26,498000
Have you ever set foot in a mosque?
你去过寺院吗

1311
01:28:26,670000 --> 01:28:29,050000
Have you ever prayed so that you can talk about it?
你祈祷过吗  谈论过精神吗

1312
01:28:29,220000 --> 01:28:32,257000
Do I have to go to a mosque to write about religion?
只有到寺院才能谈论宗教

1313
01:28:32,430000 --> 01:28:33,511000
How absurd is that?
胡扯

1314
01:28:33,680000 --> 01:28:37,218000
You keep saying the imam's feet stink. What's it to you?
你说穆拉脚很臭  你在乎些什么呢

1315
01:28:37,810000 --> 01:28:41,016000
The man walked 10 km in this cold.
他在严寒中走了10公里路

1316
01:28:41,190000 --> 01:28:44,192000
And he had to enter the room with those feet.
他去了又能做些什么呢

1317
01:28:44,650000 --> 01:28:46,860000
What exactly are you trying to say?
你什么意思

1318
01:28:47,030000 --> 01:28:49,569000
You know damn well what I'm saying.
你清楚得很

1319
01:28:50,150000 --> 01:28:51,486000
No, I don't.
不  我不明白

1320
01:28:51,660000 --> 01:28:52,905000
Then let me explain.
那我讲给你听

1321
01:28:53,070000 --> 01:28:56,412000
I find it insincere to talk about spirituality
这个男人  几乎从未去看过他父母的坟地

1322
01:28:56,580000 --> 01:28:59,417000
when you haven't shed a single tear on your parents' grave
面对坟地也从不落泪

1323
01:28:59,580000 --> 01:29:01,660000
and never even visited them.
所以他说的关于精神信仰的话  我不信

1324
01:29:01,830000 --> 01:29:04,873000
There are ways of crying you don't know, Mrs Necla.
有很多你不知道的哭泣的方式

1325
01:29:06,800000 --> 01:29:09,338000
Fine, alright. Go on then.
好  那你继续说

1326
01:29:11,380000 --> 01:29:15,053000
I wish my threshold of self-deception was as low as yours.
如果我有你这么盲目

1327
01:29:16,640000 --> 01:29:19,893000
Then I could easily find things worth doing
我一定可以找到其他新鲜有趣的玩意

1328
01:29:20,060000 --> 01:29:22,732000
and escape this boredom perhaps.
不必忍受这极致的无聊

1329
01:29:24,730000 --> 01:29:26,312000
I don't understand
我不明白

1330
01:29:26,480000 --> 01:29:29,772000
how you don't get fed up harping on like that.
你怎么这么喜欢反反复复说一件事

1331
01:29:31,280000 --> 01:29:34,782000
Applying yourself, being persistent
坚毅

1332
01:29:34,950000 --> 01:29:39,865000
is a precondition to penetrating deeper and creating new things.
是唯一可以  深化主题  创造新事物  的方式

1333
01:29:40,330000 --> 01:29:42,955000
Second, what boredom are you talking about?
我不明白你在说什么无聊的东西

1334
01:29:44,330000 --> 01:29:47,956000
I've never had a spare second to feel bored.
这没有一秒钟让我感到无聊

1335
01:29:49,300000 --> 01:29:53,381000
And in the present circumstances, I believe boredom is quite a luxury.
当今时代  无聊变成了神圣又奢侈的东西

1336
01:29:53,550000 --> 01:29:56,592000
So it wasn't a luxury in the past and now it is?
之前不是吗

1337
01:29:56,760000 --> 01:30:01,643000
Fine, I'll put it like this. Boredom is always a luxury. Happy?
好  无聊一直都很奢侈  行了吧

1338
01:30:03,520000 --> 01:30:07,437000
We are so different, we have such opposite souls.
我们该怎么解决这个问题

1339
01:30:07,610000 --> 01:30:10,149000
It's hard to believe we're related.
相信咱们并不是兄妹就行了

1340
01:30:10,570000 --> 01:30:13,738000
That's normal. Siblings are never alike.
这很寻常  所有的兄妹都这样

1341
01:30:13,900000 --> 01:30:17,240000
If one is hardworking, the other is lazy. One is clever,
一个勤奋  一个懒惰 一个聪明  一个蠢货

1342
01:30:17,246000 --> 01:30:20,120000
the other is a fool. One is sociable, the other introverted.
一个外向  一个内向

1343
01:30:20,165000 --> 01:30:21,540000
That's just how it is.
事实如此

1344
01:30:21,660000 --> 01:30:23,950000
- So? - So it's normal.
-所以呢  -所以这很寻常

1345
01:30:25,330000 --> 01:30:26,670000
I can't believe
这不足以让我理解

1346
01:30:26,830000 --> 01:30:30,622000
how I left a place like Istanbul
我是怎么离开伊斯坦布尔

1347
01:30:31,759000 --> 01:30:35,510000
and agreed to come and live with you.
来到这  和你一起埋在这

1348
01:30:36,930000 --> 01:30:39,968000
My soul's withering here.
死在这破地方

1349
01:30:40,600000 --> 01:30:43,805000
I feel at home wherever my room and my books are.
我感觉不错  我在这有房子  有书看

1350
01:30:43,980000 --> 01:30:45,854000
I feel no need for another place.

And we'll get blamed.

But to be honest, I was worried too.

so we don't have problems in the future.

我会去伊斯坦布尔的  但首先我要解决这个问题

你不相信我的经验  我的诚意

I don't think so.

There's still some left.
但还有剩呢

2428
02:52:30,630000 --> 02:52:34,333000
If that is for our heroine Mrs Nihal

And I'm thinking, man, this isn't a life.
我们没有这样的生活

2442
02:54:58,730000 --> 02:55:01,146000
It's a fire scene in a stage act.
这房子真糟糕

2443
02:55:01,320000 --> 02:55:03,650000
No fucking life, it's something else.

- True, very true. - Am I wrong?

If I reject the basis of such values, why live a life based on them?
如果我不认同这些价值观  为什么还要基于它们生活呢

2457
02:55:44,400000 --> 02:55:47,909000
Our life would be a lie then.
这样说来  我的生活非常虚伪

2458
02:55:48,070000 --> 02:55:51,698000
Either support the foundation of these values

or consolidate or create new ones.

Suavi, my brother,

then you'll have to create them.

-如果能创造  当然好  -是啊  但是听着

We want to live life to the full

2464
02:56:08,220000 --> 02:56:12,353000
but other people can criticize you for that.
但有时候会误入歧途  有人会来找麻烦

2465
02:56:12,520000 --> 02:56:16,649000
You clash, you collide with them when your paths cross.
所以在路过他们的道路时  难免会有摩擦

2466
02:56:16,810000 --> 02:56:22,522000
But curious, innovative people with strong personalities do it different.
但那些强壮  有革新精神的人 会勇往直前  毫不在意

2467
02:56:22,690000 --> 02:56:25,651000
Oddly enough, this conflict nourishes them.

In a way, it stretches them.
他们很会变通  能接受冲突

2469
02:56:30,240000 --> 02:56:32,820000

and feed their creativity.

2471
02:56:35,540000 --> 02:56:37,702000
Now when I look at them,
我看到他们的时候

2472
02:56:37,870000 --> 02:56:42,007000
they ignore the critics because they have courage.
我发现他们不在意别人的评价  因为他们很勇敢

2473
02:56:42,134000 --> 02:56:44,209000
That's the way we should be.
我们也该这样

2474
02:56:44,380000 --> 02:56:46,793000
They could come to us and say,
当然  有人会说

2475
02:56:46,970000 --> 02:56:50,341000
"You drink all that wine, stuff your faces,
"你喝酒喝得烂醉

2476
02:56:50,475000 --> 02:56:54,640000
then talk about helping the schools of the poor."
"醒了却想要帮助贫困的学校"

2477
02:56:54,850000 --> 02:56:57,974000
I say we should ignore it and move forward.
但我们不能听他们的  我们要向前看

2478
02:56:58,140000 --> 02:57:00,902000
For example, after the earthquake, six years ago,

2479
02:57:01,110000 --> 02:57:04,029000
when you didn't open your hotel to victims

2480
02:57:04,190000 --> 02:57:07,816000

maybe to line your pockets...
你赚了钱

02:57:10,410000 --> 02:57:13,745000
I mean that's what some people might think.

2483
02:57:13,910000 --> 02:57:16,288000
That's quite interesting, what he says.
他说的挺有意思

2484
02:57:16,450000 --> 02:57:20,292000
Or they might reproach you for being well-heeled.

2485
02:57:20,460000 --> 02:57:21,958000
- They might. - Hold on.

2486
02:57:22,130000 --> 02:57:23,709000
Just a minute.
请等一下

2487
02:57:24,050000 --> 02:57:26,339000
What's that got to do with it?
这段话有什么联系

2488
02:57:26,510000 --> 02:57:28,089000
How did you bring this up?
为什么突然说这个

2489
02:57:28,260000 --> 02:57:30,006000
I'm giving an example.
我举了个例子

2490
02:57:30,180000 --> 02:57:33,099000
Are you trying to imply something?
你在影射些什么

2491
02:57:33,227000 --> 02:57:37,935000
If we didn't allow victims in, there was obviously a good reason.
我们没接收那些受害者  那是有原因的...

2492
02:57:38,100000 --> 02:57:41,890000
It's easy to make unfounded allegations, with no knowledge.
你都不知道是怎么回事  又在影射些什么啊

2493
02:57:42,060000 --> 02:57:47,822000
Hundreds of people came from abroad. Where were they supposed to stay?
外国跑来了成百上千的人  能把他们放哪呢

Where were they to stay?

-我什么都没说  -没人那么想

2497

It was just an example.
我举了个例子而已

2498
02:57:59,580000 --> 02:58:04,414000
Come on, these judgments you make don't suit you, Mr Bülent.
说实话  我没想到你会这样评判别人  比伦特

2499
02:58:04,590000 --> 02:58:07,426000
- Who's judging? I was saying... - That's no good.
-我没有评判  -这样不好

2500
02:58:07,590000 --> 02:58:11,295000
I maybe didn't express myself right. I meant something else.
我可能说错话了  我是说...

2501

- Levent, you said it wrong. - I didn't.
-你这些话太坏了  莱文特  -不是得

There is some truth in what you said,

02:58:22,060000 --> 02:58:25,270000
I'm just saying these people exist...

2505
02:58:25,440000 --> 02:58:30,901000
What's your example got to do with my case?
这和我还有我的旅馆有什么关系

2506
02:58:31,070000 --> 02:58:34,077000
I just said people could talk like that.

2507
02:58:34,240000 --> 02:58:37,745000
And another thing, hold on.
更多...等等

2508
02:58:37,874000 --> 02:58:40,080000
I'm saying the same thing.
我想说

2509
02:58:40,250000 --> 02:58:45,495000
There's no counting the donations I've made over the years.
我这些年没有停止捐款

2510
02:58:45,670000 --> 02:58:47,132000
Great, but I'm saying...

Only yesterday,

I donated a huge sum to charity. How about that?

- He's right. - Bravo.

2515
02:59:00,140000 --> 02:59:02,223000
I'm not criticizing.

He just couldn't express himself.

2517
02:59:05,060000 --> 02:59:06,230000
But I still can't get rid of

the sarcasm and snide remarks.

Is it fair, just because we've got money?

All I'm saying is there are people like that.
我想说  有些人是这样的

2521
02:59:17,660000 --> 02:59:19,538000
They exist. God damn them.

2522
02:59:19,700000 --> 02:59:21,535000
I'd say God damn them too, but...
去他们的

2523
02:59:21,668000 --> 02:59:28,540000
judging like that is unacceptable before understanding all this.

2524
02:59:28,750000 --> 02:59:30,798000
I failed to express myself.

来  孩子  告诉他你说错话了

What's that got to do with it? It's irrelevant.

It's not what he meant.
那不是他的意思

No, I can't accept such a judgment.

Implicating him is a problem.

今晚话太多了  脑子跟不上了  我该住嘴了

因为有钱就被人攻击很正常啊

2537
03:00:14,550000 --> 03:00:15,835000
What can I do about it?
我能说些什么

2538
03:00:16,010000 --> 03:00:18,303000
Justice doesn't even exist in nature.

2539
03:00:18,470000 --> 03:00:20,685000
So why should it exist here?

-我是说那些人...  -这不是我的错

2541
03:00:24,140000 --> 03:00:27,314000
I'm saying the same thing but...

03:00:27,480000 --> 03:00:31,149000
you jumped on morality and conscience.
然后你扯出来道德和良心的事情了

-我说不明白  -他不能...

他没往坏处想  放轻松  孩子

2545
03:00:39,200000 --> 03:00:40,746000
You actually said nice things too.
但你说得也没错

2546
03:00:40,910000 --> 03:00:43,535000
Everything has a logic.
