00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:12,834
DOGMA 2:
The Idiots

4
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:21,717
The tension mounts, hits the roof
and falls to earth with a bang

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,638
I'd like some prawns.

6
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,717
Prawns, I'm afraid

7
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,039
- Are you alone?
- Yes.

8
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:05,476
- I'd like a salad, then.
- With Parma ham? Parmesan cheese?

9
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:10,391
And then?
We have salmon cheese.

10
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:16,634
It sounds lovely,
but I'm afraid I can't afford it.

11
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,990
A drink for your salad?

12
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,591
Can we afford a mineral water?
Or shall we use the tap?

13
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:27,952
- A mineral water.
- A mineral water. Certainly.

14
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:43,914
Your salad bon appetit.

15
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,954
Come along.

16
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:52,628
- No.
- Yes, come along.

17
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,353
No, no.

18
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:10,073
Damn you, Stoffer!

19
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:19,119
- Stoffer, pick that up!
- Klaus is coming.

20
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,638
Hi!

21
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,957
Hi, hi!

22
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:33,039
Stoffer, I don't think
they think it's funny.

23
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:42,718
There's nothing to be afraid of,
nothing is happening.

24
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,956
Nothing is happening.

25
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:50,234
- Hi, hi.
- Hi, hi.

26
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,119
Hi.

27
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:04,112
- Excuse me
- Henrik, easy does it.

28
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,789
You must keep him under control.

29
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,437
- He won't do anything.
- I must consider the other diners.

30
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,790
Henrik, Henrik,
where are you going?

31
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,753
- Where are you going?
- Klaus is coming.

32
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,996
Let's sit down again
like the waiter wants.

33
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,872
Shut up!

34
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:32,552
- It's it's his birthday.
- Happy Birthday, but it won't do.

35
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,796
Stoffer, come on, we're going home.

36
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,992
- No!
- Easy, now.

37
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:43,194
Stoffer, Stoffer, easy now.
Nothing's going to happen.

38
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:47,313
- Shut up.
- It's no good us being here, right?

39
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,478
Come on, Christoffer, we're going.

40
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:53,478
You and me?
Shall we go outside together?

41
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:57,309
- Would you?
- If he'd like to.

42
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,909
You'd be most welcome.

43
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:11,238
- Klaus is coming.
- Yes, he may be outside already.

44
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:14,796
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye and thank you.

45
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:21,113
OK, Stoffer, let go now.

46
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,595
She's not coming any further.
Let go now.

47
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,519
Stoffer, let go.

48
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:31,316
- It doesn't matter.
- Let go! The lady's not coming.

49
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:36,035
Stoffer, let go.
I've had enough.

50
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:56,634
I've had enough.
If you're going to be like this.

51
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:09,796
I don't think it's funny.

52
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,753
- Sorry, Susanne.
- Yes, sorry.

53
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:20,431
What the hell could we do?
That lunch would have cost a fortune.

54
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:29,436
- You do have the fare, don't you?
- Of course.

55
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:33,349
They're just
Don't mind them.

56
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,998
Don't worry.

57
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:46,439
Karen was the last to join the group.

58
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,995
She was really nice.
It wasn't that.

59
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,475
Karen was really nice,
but she was also

60
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,877
I think she'd have joined anything.

61
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:59,153
I don't know how she came
to the factory, but she did.

62
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,512
I don't know
I don't know what she thought.

63
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:06,996
She was right when she said
"You're poking fun".

64
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:10,556
Yes, we were poking fun.

65
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,273
Hi, Stoffer.

66
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,993
Hi.

67
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,953
Now we get out of the car again,
right?

68
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:29,472
Are you the person I talked to?
Welcome to the factory.

69
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,877
Oh, you've brought a wheelchair?

70
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:40,999
Don't leave her behind.

71
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:57,918
It may sound a bit a bit dull.

72
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:05,196
But when you get to know it,
it's actually a fascinating product.

73
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:09,712
Hey, no, no!
You mustn't do that.

74
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,672
Watch this!

75
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:17,954
I'm going to stop the entire
production of Rockwool in Denmark.

76
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:24,198
- And it stops.
- No!

77
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:28,951
- No!
- Don't worry.

78
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:33,039
Hey, you! Come over here!
Don't be frightened.

79
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:37,233
Press the green button.
Do you see it? Come on!

80
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:43,158
And the production starts again.

81
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:52,356
It's fireproof, as you see.
Nothing's on fire.

82
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,439
Don't be frightened, nothing
will happen, wait for the bang.

83
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,436
Shall we have a soda?
Yeah

84
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:08,873
Don't press that.
Just let it hang there.

85
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:18,669
Now you've heard about
Rockwool and how it works.

86
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,791
Now I'll ask you

87
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,788
which of these houses
is insulated with Rockwool?

88
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,195
Yes?

89
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,709
Come on up

90
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:34,629
That was almost right.

91
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:40,594
Those who think this one is insulated
with Rockwool, put your hands up.

92
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:46,190
Rather a lot

93
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:49,236
I think I can hear your minibus.

94
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:54,191
I think they're leaving.
Don't get left behind.

95
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:57,551
There.
That's the best place, almost.

96
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,830
_ ' BYe~bye .
- ' Bye .

97
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:03,794
That's the lot.
Give us a hand, Karen.

98
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,156
Who is he driving?

99
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:15,911
Responsibility does them good.
No, not

100
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,754
- ls that really a good idea?
- No harm done, he's doing fine.

101
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,279
Reverse, reverse!

102
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,670
Thanks for coming.

103
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:54,470
We have a driver
Who is a nutter

104
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:58,878
At our camp
At our camp

105
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:03,835
We have a driver
Who is a nutter

106
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:06,554
At our camp
Where we are

107
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,716
What do you think?

108
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,393
I don't think it was very funny.

109
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,595
Why not?

110
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:21,190
You poke fun.

111
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:36,079
- They're the ones who poke fun.
- Stoffer, cool it.

112
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,155
Anders speaking.

113
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:38,518
Is that you, Karen?

114
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:19,273
Jeppe copped out right in the middle,
and it pisses me off.

115
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:22,233
He didn't cop out.

116
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:25,159
- But you think so?
- He wasn't there.

117
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,952
It was written all over his face.

118
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:32,439
You should fucking well play along.

119
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,790
Leave him alone.

120
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,470
Did you think I was bad, too?

121
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:43,509
I wasn't watching anybody.

122
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:46,598
I was trying to feel it for myself.

123
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,916
Surely that's allowed?

124
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,078
I can't say whether
you were good or bad.

125
00:12:54,920 --> 00:13:00,517
What are you writing?
That I was good or bad or ...?

126
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,314
I write that you were

127
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:14,149
Bad.

128
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:25,920
You can sleep here if you want.
There's enough room.

129
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:28,634
I'm not going to sleep here.

130
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:32,276
I'd just like to sit a while.

131
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:36,554
I thought Jeppe was good.

132
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:41,436
- Where the hell was Jeppe good?
- He was good by the machine.

133
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:45,679
He did fuck all by the machine.
Fuck all.

134
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:48,519
I know.
That was what was so cool.

135
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:52,840
A quick summary
of what we were at?

136
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:57,477
No, an understandable summary
I've heard 17 different versions.

137
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:01,195
A quick summary? They wanted
to fuck as many as possible -

138
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:05,678
- as quickly as possible.
Isn't that so, Axel?

139
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:10,832
Axel says it was his idea.
I think it was Stoffer's.

140
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:14,749
It was my idea,
but it was Stoffer

141
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,954
who wanted to
do something about it.

142
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:21,232
That's funny; none of
the others say it was your idea.

143
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,193
How come? None of them!

144
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:29,269
Would Stoffer also
say it was a game?

145
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,596
No, I don't think so.

146
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:34,189
- But it was?
- Yes, it was, really.

147
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:02,110
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Honey.

148
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,079
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

149
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:14,432
Axel, you have a visitor.

150
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:17,916
- Actually, it's Katrine.
- Oh, shit.

151
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:22,193
- Hi.
- Hi, Katrine.

152
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:26,313
Is there something I've got wrong?
You didn't go to Jutland?

153
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:28,192
Sure.
I've been to Jutland.

154
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:32,393
Because I thought this
spassing about was pathetic.

155
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:36,195
- So what the hell are you back for?
- I've changed my mind.

156
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:40,359
- "Changed your mind?"
- Yes. ls that wrong?

157
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:44,519
You might have come
to get me back again, right?

158
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:48,269
What the hell
would I see in you, man?

159
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:52,077
- Oh, Katrine
- You think very highly of yourself.

160
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,599
Quit touching me.

161
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:56,678
Your lies are pouring out
of every hole in your body.

162
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,678
- What's your problem?
- No problem.

163
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:02,952
If that's the way you feel,
come on.

164
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:06,232
You want to go outside? Fine.

165
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,874
Stoffer?

166
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,235
Axel is telling me to beat it.

167
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,955
Pretty weird
when I've come to spass.

168
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:20,311
- She's come back to get at me.
- Who has?

169
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:22,636
Three guesses.
Say something to her.

170
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:29,075
Katrine, have you come to spass
or have you come to get Axel back?

171
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:32,158
I've come to spass.

172
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:41,713
What are you doing, Jeppe?

173
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:46,789
I'm tying this up.
First round the lake.

174
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,230
No, out of the lake, round
the palm tree, into the lake.

175
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:53,353
I'm not coming if anyone's
going to be rough or silly.

176
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:56,552
It's slippery and dangerous
and you can fall and get hurt.

177
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:00,392
You mean it's slippery
at the swimming baths?

178
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:03,239
Axel, are you going to be rough?

179
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:06,509
- Round the lake
- Don't look at me.

180
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,278
I know sod all about knots.

181
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:13,239
- Heck!
- There's a knot in it.

182
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,795
Why all this scout shit?

183
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,471
Who is minder today?
You were minder yesterday.

184
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:24,753
- Round the palm, into the lake.
- The palm? What's that?

185
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:28,316
- What do you think?
- Listen up!

186
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:31,876
It's crazy if
I'm the only one who ever minds.

187
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,435
It's unrealistic.

188
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:38,189
- Josephine can't even mind herself.
- Thanks a bunch!

189
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:42,234
Karen? How about you?

190
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:45,716
- Would you?
- Yeah, Karen!

191
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:55,352
Why are you undoing it again?
Stop stop it!

192
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:57,755
I'll tie it up.
Get into the car.

193
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:01,396
Round the damned palm
and out of the bloody lake.

194
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:02,874
No, into the lake.

195
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:06,550
- Right then.
- It's not very tight.

196
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,432
You're driving me fucking bonkers.

197
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:12,192
- They're going.
- Round the lake

198
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,995
Out of the lake, round
the palm tree, into the lake again.

199
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,636
Right then.

200
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:33,639
I'd rather not help poke fun.

201
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:36,479
Where do you get
this poking fun thing from?

202
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:58,070
Hey, lads, will you lend a hand?

203
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:01,078
- Has it broken?
- I can't figure it out.

204
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:08,596
Katrine, we've got to talk.
I've a wife and kid.

205
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:11,155
It won't do.

206
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,475
What do you want?

207
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:15,390
Maybe I bought it a size too small.

208
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:19,912
In the boutique
it fitted like a dream.

209
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,753
You want me?
Out of the question.

210
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:32,839
- It's imp
- Give her the ball.

211
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:36,029
That's right.

212
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:41,712
You are the most vicious cunt
I've ever come across.

213
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:45,879
HeY! Stop trying it on.

214
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,878
- I felt you feeling up my back.
- I wasn't.

215
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,593
You were, too.

216
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:53,872
If I do this to you
can't you feel it?

217
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:57,959
Peel? Peel? They're ...Ped?

218
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,628
Don't make passes at me
or I'll call my husband.

219
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:18,030
Go to the men's changing room
at the other end.

220
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:22,233
Stoffer, let go.
Let go, all right?

221
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:51,512
Yes, it's Stoffer's willy.
Turn round, Stoffer.

222
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,472
There.

223
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:59,799
When I think about Karen,
I think of

224
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:05,836
How do you say it in Danish?
A puppy? A little animal.

225
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:11,592
Maybe she stayed out of defiance
I don't know.

226
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:17,318
It turned out that Karen
really needed us badly.

227
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:26,749
- Why do they do it?
- That's a bloody good question.

228
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:32,239
They're searching for
their inner idiot, Karen.

229
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:37,833
What's the idea of a society
that gets richer and richer -

230
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:42,397
- when it doesn't
make anyone happier?

231
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:45,478
In the stone age, right?

232
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:50,436
All the idiots died.

233
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:56,077
It doesn't have
to be like that nowadays.

234
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:00,395
Being an idiot

235
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,796
is a luxury,
but it is also a step forward.

236
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,956
Idiots are the people of the future.

237
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:12,991
If one can find the one idiot that
happens to be one's own idiot

238
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,917
Miguel, right?

239
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:21,114
He is a happy idiot.
Because he is a happy man.

240
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,790
But there are people
who really are ill.

241
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:35,713
It's sad for the people
who are not able like us.

242
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:46,152
How can how can you
justify acting the idiot?

243
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:51,758
You can't.

244
00:22:56,160 --> 00:23:01,029
I would just like to understand.

245
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:07,435
- I mean
- Understand what?

246
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:12,270
Why I'm here.
Why I am here.

247
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:17,952
Perhaps because
there is a little idiot in there -

248
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:22,631
- that wants to come out
and have some company.

249
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:25,559
Don't you think?

250
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,234
Got the sun lotion?
Did you bring it?

251
00:23:55,440 --> 00:24:02,118
- No you think it'll tan today?
- It always tans.

252
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,158
Thanks.

253
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:21,277
After the steps,
it's downhill all the way.

254
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:26,272
How's the wind?

255
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,831
That way!

256
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:37,157
Your style, Jeppe!
Yeah!

257
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:53,552
Stop! I'm not having it.
Look how far down it is.

258
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:57,230
- Now, Jeppe, now!
- Stop it, Miguel!

259
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:14,757
How did you feel about Jeppe?

260
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:17,793
He was all right.

261
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:25,792
Would you like to phone him now?

262
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,835
- Now?
- Yes; have you talked to him since?

263
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,679
- No.
- Would you like to?

264
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:37,475
I don't know,
I don't talk to any of the others.

265
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:40,148
From the group.

266
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:43,272
Why not?

267
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:49,790
Yes, they were a family.

268
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:56,949
I Yes, they were, damn it.

269
00:26:57,160 --> 00:27:00,072
I was on the outside.
But not emotionally.

270
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:03,078
Because I loved them all.
And they know it.

271
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:08,308
Maybe we just weren't so
strong together as we thought.

272
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:14,631
Stoffer, damn it,
Axel is smashing the shed windows.

273
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:20,874
Let him! Sheds are bourgeois crap.

274
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:23,230
Smashing windows is obviously
part of Axel's inner idiot.

275
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,908
There is also a man.

276
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:28,270
- What?
- A man.

277
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,948
Fine, Miguel.

278
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:35,472
- He says he is your uncle.
- Svend?

279
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:38,433
- That's what he said, yes.
- When did he arrive?

280
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,915
- Just now.
- Has he met anyone?

281
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,918
- Were they spassing?
- No, everyone's asleep.

282
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:46,918
Thank God; it's his damned house.

283
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:49,714
I thought it was yours?

284
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:54,630
Well, it is in a way.
I'm borrowing it till it's sold.

285
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:05,117
Hi, Svend.

286
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,389
These floors, right

287
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:12,388
They were waxed every day.
Every day for fifty years.

288
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:15,433
- Every day, pal.
- Wow, bloody hell!

289
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:18,996
- Are they living here?
- Living? No

290
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,953
- But they're asleep.
- I invited them.

291
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:25,118
To help shine the place up a bit.

292
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:27,311
They're qualified craftsmen.

293
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:33,836
How interesting that
you know so many craftsmen.

294
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:38,079
What snobbery, uncle! craftsmen's
kids go to public school today.

295
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:42,394
- That's Jeppe.
- Yes?

296
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:45,558
He does the garden.

297
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:53,033
- And the flagstones.
- The flagstones, too?

298
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:02,995
- Did you get the For Sale sign?
- Yes, it was just what we needed.

299
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,509
FOR SALE

300
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:09,194
Know what?

301
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:12,233
You'd better take this seriously.

302
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:15,238
Or I'll find someone else to sell it.
You know that, right?

303
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:19,718
- What kind of craftsman is he?
- A glazier.

304
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:23,151
Luckily, as a couple of
the shed windows are broken.

305
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:29,435
We're thinking of putting hardened
glass in all the way round.

306
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:39,750
- Drive carefully.
- Not on your life.

307
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:59,795
We're so happy here.

308
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:05,799
I have no right to be so happy.

309
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:09,034
Oh, you have.

310
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:15,873
Of course you have.

311
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:22,315
You're allowed to be here
and you're allowed to be happy.

312
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:29,197
- Do you believe me?
- Yes.

313
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:48,154
Hello, we're from a commune for the
mentally handicapped up the road.

314
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:57,028
Hello is your mummy in?

315
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:06,196
Hello, we've some
Christmas decorations for sale.

316
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:11,232
- Want one?
- No, thanks.

317
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,795
How much are they?

318
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:17,518
Ped, how much are they?

319
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:20,993
£80.

320
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:24,317
- And five pence.
- They're not cheap.

321
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:28,118
What shall we say, then?

322
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:35,913
- £600.
- And five pence.

323
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:39,192
- They cost £2.
- And five pence.

324
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:42,676
- Pop inside and get £2.
- And five pence.

325
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:45,235
- And five pence and five pence.
- And five pence.

326
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:51,189
Let's hope it lasts.

327
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:56,314
Look, we made £2!

328
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:59,432
- And five pence.
- Yes, and five pence.

329
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:05,674
We've debased ourselves enough
in this shitty district.

330
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:14,711
You'd better come outside, there's
been an accident in your drive.

331
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:18,037
- Is it serious?
- I think you may say so.

332
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:22,711
The retards were out selling,
and they fell over.

333
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:26,708
You're in a spot.
Your running stones aren't flat.

334
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:28,672
- "Running stones"?!
- Yes.

335
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:33,874
They're far too high.

336
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:37,072
- Yes, but ..
- Sulked sulking

337
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:41,478
A bloody mess.
I hope you are insured.

338
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:44,433
Insured?

339
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,197
Is anybody hurt?

340
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:54,636
"Is anyone hurt?"

341
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:57,673
Well, I mean

342
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:01,156
Are you sure it was the cobbles?

343
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:03,271
Are you saying they drag their feet?

344
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:06,711
- That they're clumsy?
- No, no

345
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:09,639
That they're too clumsy
to cross your cobbles?

346
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:12,035
- Sulk
- Shut up, Jeppe.

347
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:17,155
Nobody will buy these now.
They're completely fucked.

348
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:20,955
You've spoiled things
for the retards.

349
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:23,838
- How much are they?
- £4.

350
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:27,555
- Each.
- And five pence

351
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:32,475
Society doesn't
pay to keep them -

352
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:34,636
- so they can bust their tails
on your running stones.

353
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:37,434
You've forgotten one.

354
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,072
Man man man.

355
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:47,915
Why Christmas decorations?
Why the humiliation?

356
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:49,997
No wonder people
who are already head cases -

357
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:52,794
- get a distorted picture of reality.

358
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:59,632
Would you rather make kites?

359
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:12,270
- What's this?
- Quite. What's this?

360
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:15,995
I'm Vibeke, and I talked to
your uncle about the house.

361
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:20,352
It is this house that's for sale?
There's no sign -

362
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:22,039
- and there's usually a sign.

363
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:25,277
It must have fallen down.
We must put it up again.

364
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,869
Unless I can sell to you.

365
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:30,594
It's a cute house,
isn't it?

366
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:33,633
Though it needs a bit of work.

367
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:38,470
Who'd move into anything today
and not chuck in a couple of million?

368
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:39,590
That's true.

369
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:44,078
- This will be removed.
- OK, it's not a fixture and fitting?

370
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:47,875
- No.
- We should be so lucky!

371
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:49,672
Stop it!

372
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:53,714
There is one little minus.

373
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:57,071
- Oh? What can that be?
- I have to mention it.

374
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:00,431
There is an institution
just down the road.

375
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:07,396
- An institution?
- An institution for the retarded.

376
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:13,157
I thought Smllermd District Council
had a policy in that respect?

377
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:15,396
A policy?

378
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:20,310
Of not mixing
residential areas and

379
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:23,833
institutions.

380
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:27,635
I just thought I don't know

381
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:30,195
My husband and I
have been abroad a lot.

382
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,994
One comes home
and things have moved so fast, eh?

383
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,792
Of not mixing

384
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:39,596
Residential areas, private areas,
with institutions

385
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:42,712
Oh, that kind of policy?
No, it's a myth, I think.

386
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:46,515
- How little we know!
- It's not on nowadays.

387
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:50,872
No, no, goodness, no.
It's just a bit of old nonsense.

388
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:56,837
The other people who've been to
see the house seemed to object.

389
00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:00,077
- To what?
- The institution down the road.

390
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:02,669
- Oh, yes.
- A peculiar way of thinking.

391
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:06,077
But one does meet such people,
even today.

392
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:10,353
- Most peculiar.
- It is rather an old house.

393
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:14,678
Where is it, precisely?
ls it far?

394
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:18,236
- It's next door.
- Your next door neighbour.

395
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:23,230
Yes and they've
been coming here a bit -

396
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:26,910
- while the house has been empty.
Of course, that can stop.

397
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:32,319
But the retards like picking nuts.
They pick nuts in the autumn.

398
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:38,999
But you have no objection
to the mentally handicapped?

399
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:43,034
Objections to the mentally
handicapped? Of course not.

400
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:47,438
I think it's fascinating.
It's fascinating to follow

401
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:51,915
to follow people like that.
I follow them a lot

402
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:54,554
when I see there's
a documentary on TV

403
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:58,309
It interests me a lot: their
behaviour is far more innocent

404
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:02,877
My husband had
at one time a cousin -

405
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:05,913
- who married into a family with
mentally retarded Or he had a

406
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:08,111
Your cousin was
married to a retard?

407
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:11,039
- No, no, he wasn't married to one.
- Would you like to meet them?

408
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:15,995
- They've come for a cup of tea.
- They're here now?

409
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:21,069
They do pop in now and then.
Wouldn't that be nice?

410
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,669
Damn it, yes.

411
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:29,635
- We'll meet a couple, then go.
- Susanne, line up the retards.

412
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:32,479
- Our new neighbours want to say hi.
- It's a lovely site.

413
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:37,117
- Come and say hi to the lady.
- Say hi to your new neighbours.

414
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:39,834
Finn has got a cousin who's a retard.

415
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:43,669
- So you know what it's like.
- Say hello nicely.

416
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:48,078
Actually, Finn's cousin is
oh, never mind.

417
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:51,272
We could start by saying
Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays.

418
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:53,391
- For what?
- For using the garden.

419
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:57,878
They so much need fresh air,
and we haven't many possibilities.

420
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:00,799
Can we go on coming?

421
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,992
- Coming here, I mean.
- Yes, no problem.

422
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:08,398
- That's really kind of you.
- We didn't even dare to hope

423
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:12,513
Did you hear that?
We can use their garden.

424
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:14,153
Use it like crazy.

425
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:19,718
Where zayn? Where zayn?

426
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:24,914
The Seine? The Seine's in Paris.
Nice meeting you

427
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:26,917
I could fetch a bit of paper

428
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:31,113
It's a bit soon for paper.
We've things to do first.

429
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:33,550
But we'll be
seeing you, right?

430
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:37,958
We'll see you
before I can count to ten.

431
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:41,675
See you!
Definitely!

432
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,871
' Bye~bye .

433
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:45,672
' Bye-bye, Vi beke.

434
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:50,875
- Well, Karen, we've sold the house.
- Have they bought the house?

435
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:54,038
No, definitely not.

436
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:57,471
He's just having you on.

437
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:03,198
I thought they were all very nice.
Jeppe was

438
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:05,516
Interesting to hear
that they were nice.

439
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:09,190
The idea doesn't seem polite.

440
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:12,039
No, but

441
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:17,759
No, you could put it that way.

442
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:22,388
No, no, no, Peel!

443
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:30,437
- Hi!
- Hi. Smile, everyone.

444
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:32,278
What's your name?

445
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:42,071
Shall we find some sodas and stuff?
Would you like that?

446
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:43,838
That's a good idea.

447
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:51,476
- Well, old bean?
- You're still young.

448
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:55,992
Will you pass me a soda?
lf there are any left?

449
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:05,993
Please leave me alone

450
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:12,435
- It's a bit crooked.
- Would you like to buy one?

451
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:14,870
No.

452
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,791
What are you doing?

453
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:28,199
- I'm here on holiday.
- On holiday?

454
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,834
On holiday?

455
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:34,316
What the fuck
am I meant to say?

456
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:37,956
- Are you on holiday?
- What the hell am I meant to say?

457
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:55,831
- All this sentimental crap
- What's wrong with that?

458
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:58,235
It's lovely.
They're cute.

459
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:01,398
- Cute?
- Yes.

460
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:04,478
Cute? You haven't got
the slightest fucking idea.

461
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:08,798
About what? They're
visiting and they like it here.

462
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:12,109
What's that?

463
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:15,037
- A camera.
- What for?

464
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:17,834
I was wondering
if one might take a photo.

465
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:21,794
A photo? You want to
take a photo of them?

466
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,468
Hey. let's measure
their skulls and gas them.

467
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:28,514
This is great. It's just a pity
we can't capture their genes on film.

468
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:31,518
Henrik has a camera.
May he take a photo of you?

469
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:33,790
Yes!

470
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:37,470
Hold his hand.
He'd be so pleased.

471
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:41,559
You're all looking great.
Except you, Henrik. Smile!

472
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:44,752
Henrik, Smile!

473
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:58,311
Yes, they were highly credible.

474
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:01,398
They were really good at it.

475
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:06,799
One has to be able to look
other people in the face afterwards.

476
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,514
That one can

477
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:16,030
That one doesn't take the piss
out of people the whole time.

478
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:23,757
Any retards out here?

479
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:27,476
Shut up, Nana.

480
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:32,789
Cooee! Miguel?

481
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:36,595
I get all jumpy without
you drooling over me all day.

482
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:41,316
Where's Jeppe the retard?
What's the matter with you?

483
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:44,876
They really got to you, didn't they?

484
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:49,629
Wow, it's great to be here.

485
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:07,474
Karen?

486
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:14,473
Oh, Karen, damn it!
Susanne?

487
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:19,356
Karen's gone into spass.
Karen's gone into spass.

488
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:39,471
Karen, come on, it's lovely.
Lovely water. Come on.

489
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:41,750
Is it lovely?

490
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:46,590
Look, you're floating
all by yourself.

491
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:35,836
A speaking.
I'm at baby swimming, damn it.

492
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:39,271
You can't fire me for paternity leave
when I'm actually on it.

493
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:47,672
You look like
a dickhead in that, Axel.

494
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:50,075
Dressed to kill.

495
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:51,679
When are we going to talk?

496
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:55,797
- I've got to pop into the agency.
- What for?

497
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:59,310
I've got to work on a pay-off.
A slogan.

498
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:02,956
I have to wear my best gear
to see the best people -

499
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:04,878
- and win the best customers.

500
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:07,548
- I don't see why you have to go.
- To work.

501
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:10,433
We're trying to steal
a client from another agency.

502
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:14,792
Benedikte. Scandinaviafs biggest
powdered food manufacturer.

503
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,230
When are we going to talk?

504
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:21,831
- When I'm through.
- When will that be?

505
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:25,112
When she slips off the hook
or when we land her.

506
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:28,596
- Any time you like, Babe.
- I would like

507
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:32,110
But not now.
I'm just so fucking busy.

508
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:33,799
- When I get back.
- Promise?

509
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,355
- We'll talk all you want.
- Promise?

510
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:42,510
- Yes, I promise.
- But you have a wife and baby.

511
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:47,396
That's history. Can you imagine
me pushing a pram? I'd go crazy.

512
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:48,999
It's so fucking middle class.

513
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:52,749
I don't want a wife and kid.
I want you.

514
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:06,874
Woops, here comes reality!

515
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:10,152
I'll be back in a jiffy.

516
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,514
BYE, Sugar.

517
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:22,438
Oh, Katrine!

518
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:26,592
You wade right into it,
with both legs.

519
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:36,029
What did he want with her?

520
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:39,835
To screw, shag, fuck, make love.

521
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:43,950
- All four?
- All four.

522
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:49,632
Katrine claims you held some
very anti-middle-class views.

523
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:52,718
- Or ideologies.
- I do.

524
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:56,833
What's up, darling?

525
00:46:57,040 --> 00:47:02,273
Based on what?
Your ideologies?

526
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:06,109
- "Anti-middle-class ideologies"?
- Yes.

527
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:13,632
Mainly that there is something
more than meaningfulness.

528
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:15,956
And purposefulness.

529
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:20,711
Oh? She made it sound like
something to do with the family.

530
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:25,038
Katrine played
a few tricks on Axel, I've heard.

531
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:29,919
Yes, but damn it, they were

532
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:34,912
more in the
land-him-in-the-shit genre.

533
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:42,476
A Corporation
ls A Religion

534
00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:46,275
"Child's Food".

535
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:49,793
What the fuck do you mean by that?

536
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:53,310
It's the pay-off.
Child's Food.

537
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:55,192
CHILD'S FOOD

538
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:01,390
It means it's easy.
It's food -

539
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:05,559
- and it's so easy that
even a child can make it.

540
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:08,354
I'd fucking well figured that out.

541
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:12,348
But the company does
actually make children's foods.

542
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:15,120
- I didn't know that.
- You didn't know that?

543
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:18,630
You should have checked before
coming up with such crap.

544
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:20,910
A pathetic
slip of paper.

545
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:24,829
Shut up when I'm talking to you
Saying CHILD'S FOOD.

546
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:27,679
- Is it me personally you don't like?
- No.

547
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:32,635
They're using Hjort at the moment
and they know it's hopeless.

548
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:35,479
But you've stoked
Benedikte's fires nicely.

549
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:38,240
On the phone she sounds ready.

550
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:40,556
She's crazy for you.
For some reason.

551
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:44,799
I've made some flashy folders
with charts and all.

552
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:48,709
They're for another product,
and she won't look at them anyway.

553
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:52,799
But when you come up
with crap like that

554
00:48:54,640 --> 00:49:02,479
It's known as baby food,
not child's food.

555
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:05,274
So "Child's Food"
can easily be the pay-off -

556
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:08,119
- for someone
who makes baby food.

557
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:11,756
Quite sophisticated, really.

558
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:18,237
- Baby food, child's food.
- Baby food, child's food.

559
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:21,719
Bloody hell.

560
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:24,559
She's here.
I'll go and talk to her first.

561
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:28,355
Then you come in with Svendsen.
And Severin, to be on the safe side.

562
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:32,235
But whatever she says today,
keep your balls in the air.

563
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:35,955
"Child's Food", for fuck's sake

564
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:54,078
- Svendsen.
- Benedikte.

565
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:57,829
- Severin.
- And you know each other.

566
00:49:58,040 --> 00:50:02,477
- No.
- We haven't had much time.

567
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:06,468
But sometimes that's what it takes.
A deadline

568
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:08,875
Axel, will you
show us what you've got?

569
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:14,433
Axel?

570
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:19,078
Problems?

571
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:24,273
If you're worried about taking
a client from another agency

572
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:26,789
No, it's not that.

573
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:30,788
Axel, show us what you've got,
even if it's provisional.

574
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:37,559
Ah, an itty-bitty wee thing

575
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:40,718
Child's Food

576
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:52,995
If I read you right, -

577
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:59,070
- you are favourably disposed
towards towards Child's Food.

578
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:04,638
- I think it's bloody good.
- Fine.

579
00:51:04,840 --> 00:51:09,118
We have a luxury problem.

580
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:12,710
It could be too sophisticated.

581
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:16,117
It might be confused
with children's food.

582
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:19,596
- Children baby
- It is sophisticated.

583
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:34,553
- Would you like a glass of water?
- Yes, please.

584
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:40,551
Have you got a colour printer?

585
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:44,435
If you like these colours,
we'll keep them.

586
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:50,393
May I ask
the kind of er figure

587
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:56,957
I mean how much money are we
talking about for the campaign?

588
00:51:57,160 --> 00:52:00,152
20 million?

589
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:07,198
That would be
with the buses and all.

590
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:11,234
No, the buses would come on top.

591
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:13,795
The buses would come on top

592
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:21,156
- Axel?
- Excuse me.

593
00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:25,114
I think Benedikte and I
will take a stroll.

594
00:52:25,320 --> 00:52:30,030
- Come along, Benedikte.
- Need any help?

595
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:36,431
Enjoying yourself?

596
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:38,392
I'm loving it.

597
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:40,238
Get out of here.

598
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:43,352
Phone and say
you haven't the authority.

599
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:45,790
But not that the pay-off sucks.

600
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:49,515
But it does suck.
That tiny bit of paper

601
00:52:49,720 --> 00:52:51,233
How the hell did you get in?

602
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:54,796
"Child's Food
How do you think these things up?

603
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:58,595
Is that what you do here?
I'm gobsmacked.

604
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:01,678
- It's incredible.
- Get out, Katrine.

605
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:06,396
OK, OK, I'm out of here.
Card, please.

606
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:10,036
- No way.
- OK, we'll continue the meeting.

607
00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:17,477
See you.
Is this the way out?

608
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:28,353
OK, we've talked about that now.
But why are you lying to me?

609
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:30,198
- I'm not.
- You are!

610
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:33,631
You say you didn't hump
Katrine, but I know you did.

611
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:37,594
If you want to be so
liberated and unprejudiced, -

612
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:40,758
- you have to admit
you humped the bitch.

613
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:45,511
- That's not what it's about.
- It is! You're lying.

614
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:46,994
It just isn't.

615
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:07,551
Hey, don't stare at strangers.

616
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:12,388
Excuse my brother,
he's soft in the head.

617
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:17,799
It's the tattoos, man.
He likes them.

618
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:23,438
Is it, Jeppe?
ls it the tattoos?

619
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:27,076
Look look.

620
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:34,158
Would you like to sit down, Jeppe?

621
00:54:34,360 --> 00:54:38,478
Would you like that?

622
00:54:38,680 --> 00:54:43,276
Sit down.
You're allowed.

623
00:54:53,640 --> 00:54:58,794
Good for you, meeting
such nice people, eh, Jeppe?

624
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:04,438
You'll really have a tale
to tell the other patients.

625
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:08,919
I have to use the cashpoint.

626
00:55:09,120 --> 00:55:13,796
Would you mind keeping an eye
on my brother till I get back?

627
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:18,755
- Sure, that'd be OK.
- I'll only be ten minutes.

628
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:26,155
Watch that arm, Guv.

629
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:28,476
- Is he allowed to drink?
- Yeah.

630
00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:31,717
- Easy does it.
- Cheers, Jeppe.

631
00:55:36,120 --> 00:55:39,590
He may get beaten up,
you realise?

632
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:41,916
No, they don't hit retards.

633
00:55:42,120 --> 00:55:44,714
They will if they discover
he's taking the piss.

634
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:49,118
He'll just have to play the
part, then; it'll do him good.

635
00:55:49,320 --> 00:55:51,754
He may learn something.

636
00:56:08,040 --> 00:56:12,670
Hey, Jeppe
are you clocking Linda?

637
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:15,269
Eh? Have you taken
a shine to Linda?

638
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:18,278
No no.

639
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:28,795
Where the hell is he going?
Hey, you!

640
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,753
Maybe he's just stretching his legs.

641
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:34,474
You've got to stay here.

642
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:39,872
- Where was he going?
- No idea.

643
00:56:40,080 --> 00:56:43,675
Were you trying to escape from us?

644
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:51,070
- He needs a piss, that's what it is.
- He needs a piss.

645
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:55,079
Look.“

646
00:56:58,360 --> 00:57:00,476
Right, then.

647
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:10,956
Out with the bastard
so we can get it over with.

648
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:19,511
Not much going on here.

649
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:23,474
Of course.
They can't piss by themselves.

650
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:26,638
Maybe he needs a hand.

651
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:30,079
There.

652
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:34,076
- Right!
- Drain the spuds, then.

653
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:38,554
- Come on!
- Turn the tap on, it usually works.

654
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:40,796
Come on.

655
00:57:43,120 --> 00:57:45,634
Come on.

656
00:57:45,840 --> 00:57:46,955
Come on.

657
00:57:48,040 --> 00:57:50,395
There.

658
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:58,632
A man's got to go
when a man's got to go.

659
00:57:58,840 --> 00:58:01,070
There's not much action.
Come on!

660
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:02,838
Come on!

661
00:58:04,040 --> 00:58:07,157
That's better.

662
00:58:12,320 --> 00:58:17,997
Why are you washing his hands?
He never touched his dick.

663
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:22,796
I was beginning to think
you'd taken him for a chopper ride.

664
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,833
Maybe he'd like to ride Linda?

665
00:58:26,680 --> 00:58:30,355
Say good-bye
and thank you to the kind people.

666
00:58:30,560 --> 00:58:32,516
See you around.

667
00:58:33,240 --> 00:58:35,390
Jeppe!

668
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:39,354
Come here, Jeppe!
Jeppe, damn it!

669
00:58:39,560 --> 00:58:41,312
Come back!

670
00:58:44,080 --> 00:58:46,992
Stoffer ...

671
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:50,670
I thought you were horrid to Jeppe.

672
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:54,350
He's just being a wimp.
He's always been like that.

673
00:58:54,560 --> 00:58:55,834
Boring cunt!

674
00:58:56,040 --> 00:58:58,838
Sorry
Though I don't know why.

675
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:02,510
What you did was really mean.

676
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:07,191
I don't get it.
It's so lovely here.

677
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:10,710
Why is there so much
getting at people?

678
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:14,708
- What good does it do?
- Hear that, Stoffer?

679
00:59:14,920 --> 00:59:18,435
Karen says all this
is just for getting at people.

680
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:22,952
Hey, aren't you having a hard time!
Why do you stay here, then?

681
00:59:28,520 --> 00:59:32,911
- Yes, I am a real fucking bastard.
- Not compared to me.

682
00:59:33,120 --> 00:59:35,918
You're not a bastard,
you're just egocentric.

683
00:59:36,120 --> 00:59:40,398
I'm a bastard to everyone I know.
To Katrine, to my wife

684
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:47,191
Oh, no!

685
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:52,315
You spassed hard enough to spass
Iranian caviar off the shelf?

686
00:59:52,520 --> 00:59:58,311
- I've seen it, thanks.
- £180? That's insane.

687
00:59:58,520 --> 01:00:00,511
Crazy!

688
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:04,713
Why are you poking at it?

689
01:00:07,880 --> 01:00:09,393
We're in SDHGFDd, damn it.

690
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:12,831
At least eat it
the way they eat caviar in Smllerzid.

691
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:23,355
If you can spass with yoghurt
you can spass with caviar.

692
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:30,320
That's expensive stuff.

693
01:00:30,520 --> 01:00:33,671
There are people starving

694
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:39,318
There aren't any people starving.
That's the whole trick.

695
01:00:40,920 --> 01:00:46,950
- I'd like to borrow the phone.
- Stoffer, here's 70 quids' worth.

696
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:10,117
Stoffer, there's a man from
Smllermd District Council to see you.

697
01:01:10,320 --> 01:01:11,912
From the council?

698
01:01:14,520 --> 01:01:16,988
Hello there.

699
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:20,556
I have a solution to your problem.

700
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:23,911
You have a solution to our problem?

701
01:01:24,120 --> 01:01:27,032
What problem?

702
01:01:27,240 --> 01:01:30,152
I don't know if
I've chosen the right words.

703
01:01:30,360 --> 01:01:33,397
But to boil it down to its essence -

704
01:01:33,600 --> 01:01:39,675
- we have an agreement with
a district across town, Hvidovre

705
01:01:39,880 --> 01:01:44,192
It might be advantageous to you.

706
01:01:45,640 --> 01:01:48,518
Hvidovre?

707
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:55,558
I can't tell you officially
that I can promise you a grant -

708
01:01:55,760 --> 01:01:59,958
- if you decide to transfer your
private home for the handicapped.

709
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:03,357
But the chances are good.

710
01:02:04,360 --> 01:02:08,114
If we transfer our
home for the handicapped -

711
01:02:08,320 --> 01:02:15,396
- from Smllermd to Hvidovre,
we'll get a large sum of money?

712
01:02:15,600 --> 01:02:19,434
- Not officially, but
- But?

713
01:02:19,640 --> 01:02:24,714
- Yes, you can count on it.
- You know what I think of that?

714
01:02:26,560 --> 01:02:29,791
I think it's quite fantastic.
It's damned good of you.

715
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:34,118
Well, it's not me personally,
it's the council.

716
01:02:34,320 --> 01:02:39,599
The council sussed out that
we'd run into financial problems

717
01:02:39,800 --> 01:02:42,712
Who doesn't?

718
01:02:42,920 --> 01:02:44,876
And you drop in
like manna from heaven!

719
01:02:45,080 --> 01:02:50,438
Hi, Miguel say hello
to the man from the council.

720
01:02:52,240 --> 01:02:54,196
What's the matter with him?

721
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:56,630
He's suffering from delusions.

722
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:01,111
We've three Napoleons here.

723
01:03:01,320 --> 01:03:04,517
- Does that still go on?
- Yes, sadly.

724
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:07,439
We've tried to eradicate it, but

725
01:03:07,640 --> 01:03:11,235
You can imagine how much
we spend on food alone.

726
01:03:15,920 --> 01:03:18,912
What's he so sad about?

727
01:03:19,120 --> 01:03:24,069
Miguel, can you tell the man
from the council why you're so sad?

728
01:03:26,440 --> 01:03:28,829
Waterloo.

729
01:03:29,040 --> 01:03:31,952
Waterloo?

730
01:03:34,440 --> 01:03:38,319
We really appreciate
your coming all the way out here.

731
01:03:39,840 --> 01:03:45,710
No! Axel, you're not pissing
on a council vehicle again?

732
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:50,118
I'm sorry; have you any
jumper cables I could borrow?

733
01:03:50,320 --> 01:03:53,756
Has he pissed on
a council vehicle again?

734
01:03:53,960 --> 01:03:56,838
I'm really sorry.
He doesn't mean it personally.

735
01:03:57,040 --> 01:04:00,510
It's a cure we have.
We call it the Smllermd cure.

736
01:04:00,720 --> 01:04:03,792
He's got to learn.

737
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:08,198
The red one on the right, Ped.
The black on the left.

738
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:12,393
We'll give him shock therapy,
the fucking retard.

739
01:04:13,840 --> 01:04:16,752
Rev up, damn it!

740
01:04:19,880 --> 01:04:23,350
You'll need the police
and dogs to get us out.

741
01:04:23,560 --> 01:04:26,393
Smllermd fascists!

742
01:04:26,600 --> 01:04:31,116
Fascist pricks!
Smllermd fascists!

743
01:04:32,920 --> 01:04:35,753
Fucking fascists!

744
01:04:35,960 --> 01:04:38,474
Cock suckers!

745
01:04:38,680 --> 01:04:43,470
Council bastards!
Smllermd fascists!

746
01:04:43,680 --> 01:04:47,036
Shithead!
Smllermd fascist!

747
01:04:47,240 --> 01:04:49,913
Fucking SDHGFDd fascists!

748
01:04:50,120 --> 01:04:54,193
- You're stark raving mad.
- Fascist bastard!

749
01:04:56,760 --> 01:04:59,672
Fucking fascists!

750
01:04:59,880 --> 01:05:01,757
Calm down, Stoffer.

751
01:05:04,560 --> 01:05:07,279
Get him into the bus.

752
01:05:08,520 --> 01:05:10,476
Gently does it

753
01:05:10,680 --> 01:05:12,557
I think he's hurt.

754
01:05:12,760 --> 01:05:15,069
Fucking fascists

755
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:18,909
Stoffer, calm down.

756
01:05:19,120 --> 01:05:22,078
That will fucking well do, Stoffer.
Come on.

757
01:05:32,600 --> 01:05:33,953
Up to bed.

758
01:05:36,040 --> 01:05:39,077
- You can't lug him up there.
- You're pathetic.

759
01:05:39,280 --> 01:05:42,670
Are you putting me
in the padded cell?

760
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:46,236
You are so fucking pathetic.

761
01:05:46,440 --> 01:05:51,309
You are really zinging.
You need to relax.

762
01:05:51,520 --> 01:05:54,034
Nana, will you get him a blanket?

763
01:05:54,240 --> 01:05:56,470
Can't we put him
in an ordinary bed?

764
01:05:56,680 --> 01:06:02,038
- Stoffer, we have to tie you down.
- You think I've gone really mad?

765
01:06:02,240 --> 01:06:04,196
Are you scared now?

766
01:06:05,480 --> 01:06:08,313
- Listen
- I won't hit anyone.

767
01:06:08,520 --> 01:06:10,476
You did before.

768
01:06:11,960 --> 01:06:14,474
I'm not the type who hits people.

769
01:06:14,680 --> 01:06:19,356
- OK, OK.
- I don't hit people.

770
01:06:19,560 --> 01:06:22,870
Want a drink?

771
01:06:24,680 --> 01:06:27,433
Untie that one.

772
01:06:27,640 --> 01:06:30,393
Fucking fascists!
Smllermd fascists!

773
01:06:30,600 --> 01:06:31,999
Smllermd fascists!

774
01:06:32,200 --> 01:06:34,270
- Stop it.
- Where's the belt?

775
01:06:34,480 --> 01:06:37,233
Out of the lake,
round the palm tree, into the lake.

776
01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:40,750
- Surely it's not that difficult?
- Not so hard.

777
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:45,033
- Stop it, Stoffer.
- Fascists, man.

778
01:06:45,240 --> 01:06:46,559
Chill out!

779
01:07:00,800 --> 01:07:05,430
We'll loosen the flex
and leave him here, OK?

780
01:07:17,880 --> 01:07:21,316
And you miss the family?

781
01:07:23,160 --> 01:07:26,118
I do, as a matter of fact.

782
01:07:26,680 --> 01:07:32,835
I don't know how I figured that
I didn't want to see them again.

783
01:07:37,800 --> 01:07:40,598
I just think it's over.

784
01:07:41,360 --> 01:07:46,912
I don't think we can find
the same fine things -

785
01:07:47,120 --> 01:07:50,954
- that we found there.

786
01:07:51,640 --> 01:07:54,518
We can't find them again.

787
01:07:54,720 --> 01:08:00,192
I was the one who was
with Karen on the last day.

788
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:03,278
And I was the one
who said good-bye to her.

789
01:08:03,480 --> 01:08:06,074
Music and dancing.

790
01:08:06,280 --> 01:08:11,513
Lots of flags
to cheer him up.

791
01:08:21,200 --> 01:08:24,158
Did you sleep well?

792
01:08:26,720 --> 01:08:30,315
You might at least have
tied me to a decent bed.

793
01:08:30,520 --> 01:08:34,638
- What are you doing?
- Making a party.

794
01:08:36,800 --> 01:08:41,191
- We thought we needed a party.
- A party?

795
01:08:41,400 --> 01:08:44,517
We're going to have a party?

796
01:08:44,720 --> 01:08:47,678
- That's right.
- For me?

797
01:08:47,880 --> 01:08:49,598
Yes.

798
01:08:49,800 --> 01:08:51,472
Because it's my birthday?

799
01:08:51,680 --> 01:08:55,309
It's not my real birthday.

800
01:08:55,520 --> 01:08:59,354
Well, we're not real retards, are we?

801
01:08:59,560 --> 01:09:01,869
May we come in?

802
01:09:02,080 --> 01:09:05,595
- Are you ready?
- Ticket.

803
01:09:12,040 --> 01:09:14,474
Wow, what a rave!

804
01:09:14,680 --> 01:09:21,313
Jeppe, look at the ticket
and tear it in half.

805
01:09:21,520 --> 01:09:26,640
I'll do it, then Frrrt.
Now you can go in.

806
01:09:26,840 --> 01:09:29,912
Come on

807
01:09:40,640 --> 01:09:43,393
Jeeze, things are really swinging.

808
01:09:46,960 --> 01:09:49,872
We're the ones
the others can't play with

809
01:09:50,080 --> 01:09:54,358
We're the ones
the others can't play with

810
01:09:58,440 --> 01:10:02,399
I think Stoffer should
choose what we do next.

811
01:10:02,600 --> 01:10:05,239
Because it's his party.

812
01:10:05,440 --> 01:10:07,032
Gang bang.

813
01:10:07,240 --> 01:10:10,676
No, listen, we've got picture lotto,
spin the bottle

814
01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:13,075
Gang bang.

815
01:10:13,280 --> 01:10:17,034
Count me in.
Gang bang! Gang bang!

816
01:10:17,240 --> 01:10:20,471
Sure! I'd love a spasser fuck.

817
01:10:20,680 --> 01:10:23,956
Gang bang!

818
01:10:38,680 --> 01:10:41,433
Gang bang

819
01:10:41,640 --> 01:10:42,755
Hey, hey, hey!

820
01:10:58,720 --> 01:11:01,280
No, I'm not joining in.

821
01:11:03,520 --> 01:11:06,318
Susanne!

822
01:11:06,520 --> 01:11:08,988
- Come on
- No.

823
01:11:09,200 --> 01:11:11,998
Yes Gang bang!

824
01:11:12,200 --> 01:11:15,272
- Susanne.
- They're my knickers.

825
01:11:15,480 --> 01:11:19,075
Go over there.
I'll sit and Stop it, Stoffer!

826
01:11:19,280 --> 01:11:24,149
- I can't undo my
- Can't you?

827
01:11:24,360 --> 01:11:29,514
Stop it!

828
01:11:34,720 --> 01:11:36,551
Stoffer, I don't want to.

829
01:11:36,760 --> 01:11:40,878
I'll go home.
I'm not having this.

830
01:11:41,080 --> 01:11:45,039
I'm running away.
Home.

831
01:11:50,520 --> 01:11:53,751
U Stop it!
I rn going home!

832
01:11:53,960 --> 01:11:56,872
Go away.
No!

833
01:11:58,040 --> 01:12:00,315
Good-bye.

834
01:12:02,280 --> 01:12:08,150
- Gang bang Gang bang
- Yes

835
01:12:12,760 --> 01:12:15,228
I'll give you gang bang!

836
01:12:15,440 --> 01:12:18,034
Yes, Susanne!

837
01:12:18,240 --> 01:12:20,674
OK, I'll just take these off, too.

838
01:12:26,920 --> 01:12:31,072
I'm ready and waiting.

839
01:12:35,480 --> 01:12:38,677
This is lovely, really lovely.

840
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:45,233
Katrine, aren't you jealous?

841
01:15:45,840 --> 01:15:48,559
I love you.

842
01:15:51,160 --> 01:15:53,515
I love you.

843
01:16:42,480 --> 01:16:47,076
The room was full of style
till you brought those Lilos.

844
01:16:47,280 --> 01:16:50,477
- They cost 7 quid a piece.
- A four-poster would be better.

845
01:16:50,680 --> 01:16:55,595
Peel! There's no
getting away from it.

846
01:16:55,800 --> 01:16:59,554
He snores like hell, and it is
getting worse as he gets older.

847
01:17:10,640 --> 01:17:12,596
- It's my father.
- Hello.

848
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:16,679
- Hello, Dad.
- Hello, Josephine.

849
01:17:16,880 --> 01:17:21,715
This is Katrine and Ped and Axel.

850
01:17:21,920 --> 01:17:24,639
- Hello.
- Would you like a cup of tea?

851
01:17:24,840 --> 01:17:28,674
- Sit down?
- Yes, please.

852
01:17:34,800 --> 01:17:36,916
- I'm Jeppe.
- Josy's father.

853
01:17:37,120 --> 01:17:41,159
Stoffer have a seat.

854
01:17:43,400 --> 01:17:46,597
You just happened to be passing?

855
01:17:47,480 --> 01:17:50,711
We have a little group.

856
01:17:51,960 --> 01:17:54,155
A tired group.

857
01:17:54,360 --> 01:17:58,831
- Do you take sugar?
- Thanks.

858
01:18:01,720 --> 01:18:04,996
We are a bit tired.

859
01:18:08,320 --> 01:18:11,357
Maybe you've heard of our group?

860
01:18:12,520 --> 01:18:15,239
No

861
01:18:16,160 --> 01:18:20,119
- No.
- Oh.

862
01:18:23,120 --> 01:18:25,395
You make it sound like a rock band.

863
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:27,750
Maybe we should form one.

864
01:18:27,960 --> 01:18:30,758
That would be a great idea.

865
01:18:31,800 --> 01:18:35,395
What do you think?
Of us?

866
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:38,910
- What do I think of you?
- Yes.

867
01:18:39,120 --> 01:18:41,680
Well

868
01:18:43,240 --> 01:18:47,472
They're nice people.
They enjoy what they do.

869
01:18:47,680 --> 01:18:50,558
I'm sure they do.

870
01:18:50,760 --> 01:18:54,594
We're really, really happy.

871
01:19:10,440 --> 01:19:12,396
Maybe you've heard
about our little

872
01:19:12,600 --> 01:19:16,957
I'm not interested
in discussing what you do.

873
01:19:17,160 --> 01:19:20,436
I couldn't care less.

874
01:19:36,920 --> 01:19:40,356
Couldn't care less?

875
01:19:41,960 --> 01:19:48,354
If you could see things differently
you might see the beauty of them.

876
01:19:48,560 --> 01:19:52,155
In vino veritas

877
01:19:55,400 --> 01:19:59,109
What the hell do you mean by that?
I may be right.

878
01:19:59,320 --> 01:20:01,880
It doesn't interest me.

879
01:20:02,080 --> 01:20:03,911
- It doesn't?
- No.

880
01:20:04,120 --> 01:20:07,032
Why did you come, then?

881
01:20:12,120 --> 01:20:17,194
Obviously an outsider
can't see what it means.

882
01:20:17,400 --> 01:20:20,233
You should see some of the
wonderful things we've shared.

883
01:20:20,440 --> 01:20:24,115
People are happy.
They're thriving.

884
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:27,039
- They are!
- I'm not going to argue.

885
01:20:27,240 --> 01:20:30,789
We're not arguing.
Ask anyone if they're happy.

886
01:20:33,280 --> 01:20:36,511
Josephine is happy here.

887
01:20:36,720 --> 01:20:40,793
- It certainly looks like it.
- That's because you're here.

888
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:45,357
She was fine until you came.
But then you came crashing in.

889
01:20:47,560 --> 01:20:50,996
I am really happy here.

890
01:20:55,160 --> 01:21:00,757
- I've come to take you home.
- No you can't do that.

891
01:21:02,680 --> 01:21:05,148
Yes.

892
01:21:05,800 --> 01:21:08,872
Yes, I can.

893
01:21:15,320 --> 01:21:20,155
- You see, I can't trust you.
- What do you mean?

894
01:21:20,360 --> 01:21:22,635
- Bullshit.
- What do you mean?

895
01:21:22,840 --> 01:21:25,798
You haven't been taking your pills.

896
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:29,197
- We'd agreed she'd
- I have been taking them.

897
01:21:29,400 --> 01:21:35,714
Damn it, Josephine
the jar was in the drawer at home.

898
01:21:35,920 --> 01:21:38,673
I can't look after you unless

899
01:21:38,880 --> 01:21:42,190
Why should she take
a load of fucking pills?

900
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:44,709
I can't.

901
01:21:47,640 --> 01:21:53,590
- You're going through hell.
- I'm not I'm not.

902
01:22:02,760 --> 01:22:07,436
For the first time,
I'm feeling really great.

903
01:22:15,560 --> 01:22:18,438
Can't we find a compromise?

904
01:22:20,480 --> 01:22:22,675
Listen

905
01:22:22,880 --> 01:22:25,269
- We're fond of Josephine.
- Listen!

906
01:22:25,480 --> 01:22:30,998
We don't like you.
If you left there'd be no problem.

907
01:22:33,400 --> 01:22:36,836
She doesn't look as if
she wants to go with you.

908
01:22:37,040 --> 01:22:39,076
Listen

909
01:22:39,920 --> 01:22:43,037
This may be a game to you.

910
01:22:43,240 --> 01:22:47,552
And good luck to you.

911
01:22:48,880 --> 01:22:54,113
But it takes nothing to make
Josephine seriously ill.

912
01:22:54,320 --> 01:23:00,111
Keep your shirt on.
I'm a doctor. I'd never permit

913
01:23:00,320 --> 01:23:03,596
I don't think you're a doctor
I'd choose to go to.

914
01:23:03,800 --> 01:23:06,633
I don't think so.

915
01:23:08,280 --> 01:23:10,555
Come along, Josephine.

916
01:23:12,160 --> 01:23:14,958
No, I don't want to go.

917
01:23:15,160 --> 01:23:20,314
If you've any bits and pieces,
pop upstairs and get them.

918
01:23:20,520 --> 01:23:25,116
- I don't want to go home.
- Did you hear what I said?

919
01:23:25,320 --> 01:23:28,232
Josephine

920
01:23:29,560 --> 01:23:31,949
Answer me have you any?

921
01:23:32,160 --> 01:23:36,119
- Yes.
- Go and get them, and we'll go.

922
01:23:44,400 --> 01:23:45,879
What the fuck can he do to you?

923
01:23:46,080 --> 01:23:49,277
Stay here!
All you have to do is say the word.

924
01:23:49,480 --> 01:23:52,119
He can't hurt you.

925
01:23:56,400 --> 01:23:59,870
What right's he got?

926
01:24:02,240 --> 01:24:06,358
- Ped, what were those pills?
- I know nothing about any pills.

927
01:24:06,560 --> 01:24:10,519
Aren't you a doctor, damn it?
You said you knew about it.

928
01:24:10,720 --> 01:24:14,952
- So what kind of pills is she on?
- I don't know.

929
01:24:15,160 --> 01:24:18,470
- You must know.
- She never mentioned pills.

930
01:24:18,680 --> 01:24:20,671
And she doesn't need pills.

931
01:24:22,240 --> 01:24:27,234
Josephine, just stay!
He can't do anything to you.

932
01:24:27,440 --> 01:24:30,079
Stay here!

933
01:24:30,280 --> 01:24:35,035
- We can't force anyone to stay.
- Force? He's forcing her.

934
01:24:35,240 --> 01:24:38,835
It's their business.
We can't cure anyone here.

935
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:43,511
- That's not our aim.
- Aim? Up yours, man!

936
01:24:43,720 --> 01:24:48,157
Josephine
There should be a law against it.

937
01:24:50,240 --> 01:24:53,755
Get out of here!
She doesn't want to go with you.

938
01:24:53,960 --> 01:24:59,432
If you'd really been a proper father
she'd have been all right today.

939
01:25:02,400 --> 01:25:06,712
We can't force anyone to stay
against their will.

940
01:25:06,920 --> 01:25:09,195
Jeppe!

941
01:25:14,240 --> 01:25:17,118
Jeppe, for fuck's sake!

942
01:25:17,680 --> 01:25:20,433
Jeppe, for fuck's sake

943
01:25:32,280 --> 01:25:38,230
You're insane.
Insane in the head.

944
01:25:46,680 --> 01:25:48,750
You're insane.

945
01:25:48,960 --> 01:25:51,394
What are you doing?

946
01:25:52,960 --> 01:25:57,670
- We'll move him.
- We'll move him, damn you.

947
01:25:57,880 --> 01:26:00,758
No!

948
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:04,157
No!

949
01:26:04,960 --> 01:26:08,032
Go now, damn you!

950
01:26:14,200 --> 01:26:16,430
Please get out of the way.

951
01:26:16,640 --> 01:26:19,518
Please get out of the way.

952
01:26:26,840 --> 01:26:28,876
No!

953
01:26:37,600 --> 01:26:40,068
Deep breaths.

954
01:26:40,280 --> 01:26:43,829
All the way down.
On your feet, now.

955
01:26:44,040 --> 01:26:46,474
Stand back,
I know how to deal with this.

956
01:26:46,680 --> 01:26:51,800
- Stop being so aggressive.
- You've no fucking idea. No idea.

957
01:26:56,560 --> 01:26:59,518
Jeppe,babV-~

958
01:27:12,080 --> 01:27:15,470
ls there any booze in the house?

959
01:27:15,680 --> 01:27:19,639
Is there any left over from the

960
01:27:19,840 --> 01:27:23,833
- There's vodka in the cupboard.
- And beer in the bathtub.

961
01:27:26,680 --> 01:27:32,869
Please stop doing your nails.
It kind of stresses me out.

962
01:27:35,600 --> 01:27:41,630
Dr Doolittle is scribbling away
it must be interesting, eh?

963
01:27:41,840 --> 01:27:44,798
Will it result in a doctorate?

964
01:27:46,960 --> 01:27:50,191
- Maybe.
- Got lots of pearls of wisdom?

965
01:27:50,400 --> 01:27:52,994
And how about Henrik
the art teacher?

966
01:27:53,200 --> 01:27:55,555
Do you think your work's any good?

967
01:27:56,120 --> 01:27:58,111
It was an experiment.

968
01:27:58,320 --> 01:28:02,711
- An experiment?
- I like the top one.

969
01:28:02,920 --> 01:28:07,948
And you feel you'll be more of an
artist if you go a teeny bit mad?

970
01:28:08,160 --> 01:28:11,152
But not too much.
Just enough to be a proper artist.

971
01:28:13,440 --> 01:28:15,670
You've no bloody talent
at any rate.

972
01:28:15,880 --> 01:28:21,432
- It isn't the way I'd imagined it.
- You'd imagined it?

973
01:28:21,640 --> 01:28:26,953
Your pathetic little spassing bit
is the only thing that matters.

974
01:28:27,160 --> 01:28:31,153
If you'd opened your gob outside,
she would have stayed.

975
01:28:31,360 --> 01:28:35,239
- But now he's upstairs screaming.
- She's right, Stoffer.

976
01:28:35,440 --> 01:28:40,639
Ped, Henrik, Jeppe and Josephine
are just as good retards as you.

977
01:28:40,840 --> 01:28:43,957
Oh, now I've put my foot in it.

978
01:28:44,160 --> 01:28:46,355
I have no faith in you.

979
01:28:46,560 --> 01:28:50,348
The moment it starts hurting
just a bit, you bottle out.

980
01:28:50,560 --> 01:28:55,315
Tell us what you expect of us, then.
Tell us what you want!

981
01:28:55,520 --> 01:29:01,197
For you to prove that you are really
into the whole idea. Axel, prove it.

982
01:29:01,400 --> 01:29:04,949
Sod off home and spass.

983
01:29:05,160 --> 01:29:08,755
Freaking out in Smllermd
is no big deal.

984
01:29:08,960 --> 01:29:12,475
If you can go back
to your families or jobs -

985
01:29:12,680 --> 01:29:15,752
- and still be a spasser,
I'll believe you're serious.

986
01:29:15,960 --> 01:29:19,669
- None of you has the guts.
- Listen

987
01:29:19,880 --> 01:29:24,396
Stoffer is mocking us.
Mocking The Idiots.

988
01:29:24,600 --> 01:29:30,232
Of course we can go home
and spass. Or spass at work.

989
01:29:30,440 --> 01:29:37,039
Otherwise it's worthless.
Either you're an idiot or you aren't.

990
01:29:40,600 --> 01:29:42,716
Who's going first?

991
01:29:46,920 --> 01:29:51,357
Come on
whoever the bottle points at

992
01:29:52,120 --> 01:29:56,955
will go somewhere where the
people you're with really matter.

993
01:29:57,160 --> 01:30:00,835
Shut up, Susanne,
this is important.

994
01:30:01,040 --> 01:30:03,918
Aren't you in on it?

995
01:30:04,120 --> 01:30:05,712
And Jeppe and Karen?

996
01:30:05,920 --> 01:30:10,596
I've never heard Karen boast
that she was a great spasser.

997
01:30:10,800 --> 01:30:14,918
That's Jeppe. If it points
over there or here, I'm it.

998
01:30:36,600 --> 01:30:40,639
Fine, I'll go back to
Mona and the baby and spass.

999
01:30:40,840 --> 01:30:43,832
Or to the agency.

1000
01:30:44,040 --> 01:30:46,952
In fact, that would be
really, really awful for you.

1001
01:30:47,160 --> 01:30:52,393
You just promised, man.

1002
01:30:57,640 --> 01:31:01,599
You want me to flush my whole
family life down the toilet?

1003
01:31:01,800 --> 01:31:03,756
Nobody's saying that.

1004
01:31:03,960 --> 01:31:08,875
Your sow of a wife will just have
to learn to love your inner idiot.

1005
01:31:16,320 --> 01:31:18,595
I can't.

1006
01:31:20,320 --> 01:31:22,834
I can't.

1007
01:31:39,200 --> 01:31:41,236
Axel?

1008
01:31:42,200 --> 01:31:44,191
Come here a moment, Axel.

1009
01:31:44,400 --> 01:31:47,517
Axel!

1010
01:31:50,480 --> 01:31:53,313
Another spin of the bottle, then.

1011
01:32:10,360 --> 01:32:12,590
Yes

1012
01:32:18,680 --> 01:32:20,671
When?

1013
01:32:32,840 --> 01:32:34,512
This is for you.
Welcome back.

1014
01:32:34,720 --> 01:32:37,712
Thanks.

1015
01:32:39,120 --> 01:32:42,795
Henrik, I have a little question.

1016
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:46,913
Have we done the obelisks?

1017
01:32:47,120 --> 01:32:51,398
- The obelisks? Oh, the Odalisques!
- ls he going to spass or what?

1018
01:32:51,600 --> 01:32:53,477
He's doing bugger all.

1019
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:04,788
I think it's time
for us to consider

1020
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:07,514
the calligraphy in Matisse.

1021
01:33:07,720 --> 01:33:11,952
Primarily I mean
"Les Fleurs du Mal", 1944.

1022
01:33:12,160 --> 01:33:13,957
Oh, them? Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1023
01:33:14,160 --> 01:33:17,914
Whether Matisse was
completely aware of his

1024
01:33:18,840 --> 01:33:20,068
effect on the bourgeoisie, -

1025
01:33:20,280 --> 01:33:24,751
- he was certainly provocative
and full of surprises.

1026
01:33:24,960 --> 01:33:28,509
Nobody could accuse you of that.

1027
01:33:28,720 --> 01:33:30,233
I need some air.

1028
01:33:30,440 --> 01:33:32,476
- Hello!
- Yes?

1029
01:33:32,680 --> 01:33:37,196
What's going on? Fuck all.
You love this middle-class crap.

1030
01:33:37,400 --> 01:33:43,430
These old biddies use more
make-up than the National Theatre.

1031
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:55,758
It's lovely to have Henrik back,
don't you think?

1032
01:34:08,320 --> 01:34:11,790
What happened?

1033
01:34:13,040 --> 01:34:17,431
We didn't come to hear about
a French faggot and his calligraphy.

1034
01:34:17,640 --> 01:34:20,950
It's too fucking bad.

1035
01:34:21,160 --> 01:34:25,438
- I tried.
- You coughed three times.

1036
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:32,515
- It wasn't that easy.
- No.

1037
01:34:32,720 --> 01:34:38,113
Stoffer is right.
It wasn't good enough.

1038
01:34:38,320 --> 01:34:42,233
I had no pride in my inner idiot.
I wasn't good enough.

1039
01:34:42,440 --> 01:34:44,954
You did try.

1040
01:34:45,160 --> 01:34:47,720
I'm not coming back with you.

1041
01:34:59,320 --> 01:35:02,039
OK.

1042
01:35:23,560 --> 01:35:26,279
Ready yet?

1043
01:35:34,080 --> 01:35:36,310
Karen, my love.

1044
01:35:36,520 --> 01:35:38,272
Take care, now.

1045
01:35:38,480 --> 01:35:41,438
Take care.

1046
01:35:43,160 --> 01:35:45,435
Nana.“

1047
01:35:47,480 --> 01:35:51,758
Let them go, Karen.
It was all a lie.

1048
01:35:51,960 --> 01:35:54,713
I have something I want to say.

1049
01:36:00,920 --> 01:36:03,309
I just want to say

1050
01:36:04,800 --> 01:36:07,155
how happy I have been here.

1051
01:36:11,120 --> 01:36:16,114
Being an idiot with you is one
of the best things I've ever done.

1052
01:36:19,480 --> 01:36:21,675
JePPe

1053
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:27,630
who is almost like
a little child I might have had.

1054
01:36:29,200 --> 01:36:31,839
And Nana, -

1055
01:36:32,360 --> 01:36:35,158
- who is so sweet and funny.

1056
01:36:35,800 --> 01:36:38,598
And Miguel, -

1057
01:36:38,800 --> 01:36:41,997
- who has such lovely eyes.

1058
01:36:42,200 --> 01:36:47,149
And Ped, who is such a clever man.

1059
01:36:49,640 --> 01:36:53,519
And strong, strong Katrine.

1060
01:37:00,680 --> 01:37:03,035
And Susanne

1061
01:37:05,400 --> 01:37:12,078
who smiles at everyone so that
the very heavens shine down upon us.

1062
01:37:14,280 --> 01:37:16,510
I believe

1063
01:37:18,120 --> 01:37:20,793
I love you all -

1064
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:25,357
- more than I have
ever loved anybody.

1065
01:37:28,360 --> 01:37:32,831
Maybe with one exception.
But that was so long ago now.

1066
01:37:40,880 --> 01:37:45,749
- What day is it tomorrow?
- It's Saturday.

1067
01:37:48,680 --> 01:37:51,831
Then it can be done.

1068
01:37:58,800 --> 01:38:05,911
It is my turn to go home
and see if I can be an idiot there.

1069
01:38:08,080 --> 01:38:12,073
I suppose I'll need
to take one of you along.

1070
01:38:14,040 --> 01:38:17,350
But there isn't room for everyone.

1071
01:38:23,880 --> 01:38:27,156
It may not be very pleasant.

1072
01:38:32,560 --> 01:38:36,599
I think I'd like to take Susanne.

1073
01:38:39,680 --> 01:38:43,116
Will you come?

1074
01:38:43,320 --> 01:38:46,073
I'd like that.

1075
01:38:49,800 --> 01:38:52,394
Good.

1076
01:38:55,480 --> 01:39:01,191
We'll see if I can show you
that it has all been worthwhile.

1077
01:39:27,560 --> 01:39:32,076
- Hello, Mother.
- Hello, Karen.

1078
01:39:37,360 --> 01:39:39,874
Come in.

1079
01:39:45,640 --> 01:39:48,438
Shall I take your jacket?

1080
01:39:56,320 --> 01:39:58,754
Karen

1081
01:39:59,840 --> 01:40:03,435
Where have you been?

1082
01:40:03,640 --> 01:40:06,598
We thought you were dead.

1083
01:40:06,800 --> 01:40:09,951
This is Susanne.

1084
01:40:10,160 --> 01:40:12,628
And my sister, Britta.

1085
01:40:18,040 --> 01:40:20,270
Louise?

1086
01:40:24,040 --> 01:40:26,634
Karen's come.

1087
01:40:29,360 --> 01:40:32,158
What do you want?

1088
01:40:32,360 --> 01:40:36,911
I just wanted to see how you
all were This is Susanne.

1089
01:40:39,080 --> 01:40:41,674
Anders is coming.

1090
01:40:41,880 --> 01:40:44,633
Yes, I suppose he is.

1091
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:49,276
Karen, is that you?

1092
01:40:49,480 --> 01:40:51,789
Yes, Grandpa.

1093
01:41:05,720 --> 01:41:09,793
We haven't seen her for two weeks.

1094
01:41:14,640 --> 01:41:19,316
Not since the day before the funeral.

1095
01:41:29,120 --> 01:41:34,956
Anders and Karen
lost their little boy.

1096
01:41:36,120 --> 01:41:39,476
It probably hurt Anders most.

1097
01:41:40,800 --> 01:41:44,873
What with her just disappearing
and not attending the funeral.

1098
01:42:22,320 --> 01:42:25,357
<i>MY pet </i>

1099
01:42:43,520 --> 01:42:46,159
That'll be Anders.

1100
01:42:53,080 --> 01:42:57,392
- Hello, Grandpa.
- Hello, Anders.

1101
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:03,117
Hello, Anders.

1102
01:43:03,320 --> 01:43:06,232
Hello, Karen.

1103
01:43:21,040 --> 01:43:24,589
I'm sorry I couldn't come to

1104
01:43:25,920 --> 01:43:29,390
To Martin's funeral.

1105
01:43:30,400 --> 01:43:33,870
It just means you aren't too upset.

1106
01:43:34,080 --> 01:43:35,832
That's fine.

1107
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:52,560
Louise?

1108
01:44:20,600 --> 01:44:23,239
Do begin.

1109
01:46:11,080 --> 01:46:13,230
That's enough now, Karen.

1110
01:46:24,720 --> 01:46:26,676
Shall we go?

1111
01:46:39,040 --> 01:46:41,998
Yes.
